<a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION<br
 /><small class="toclink"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></small></h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="chapstart"><span class="start">I&nbsp;have</span> been asked by a friend, who heard of this
book being published, what the difference
would be between it and the previous one on the
same subject, <span class="smc">With Christ in the School of
Prayer</span>. An answer to that question may be the
best introduction I can give to the present volume.</p>

<p>Any acceptance the former work has had must
be attributed, as far as the contents go, to the
prominence given to two great truths. The one
was, the certainty that prayer will be answered.
There is with some an idea that to ask and expect
an answer is not the highest form of prayer.
Fellowship with God, apart from any request, is
more than supplication. About the petition there
is something of selfishness and bargaining&mdash;to
worship is more than to beg. With others the
thought that prayer is so often unanswered is so
prominent, that they think more of the spiritual
benefit derived from the exercise of prayer than
<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">2</span><span class="ns">] </span>
the actual gifts to be obtained by it. While
admitting the measure of truth in these views,
when kept in their true place, <span class="smc">The School of
Prayer</span> points out how our Lord continually spoke
of prayer as a means of obtaining what we desire,
and how He seeks in every possible way to waken
in us the confident expectation of an answer. I
was led to show how prayer, in which a man could
enter into the mind of God, could assert the royal
power of a renewed will, and bring down to earth
what without prayer would not have been given, is
the highest proof of his having been made in the
likeness of God&#8217;s Son. He is found worthy of
entering into fellowship with Him, not only in
adoration and worship, but in having his will actually
taken up into the rule of the world, and becoming
the intelligent channel through which God can
fulfil his eternal purpose. The book sought to
reiterate and enforce the precious truths Christ
preaches so continually: the blessing of prayer is
that you can ask and receive what you will: the
highest exercise and the glory of prayer is that
persevering importunity can prevail and obtain
what God at first could not and would not give.</p>

<p>With this truth there was a second one that
came out very strongly as we studied the Master&#8217;s
words. In answer to the question, But why, if the
answer to prayer is so positively promised, why are
<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">3</span><span class="ns">] </span>
there such numberless unanswered prayers? we
found that Christ taught us that the answer
depended upon certain conditions. He spoke of
faith, of perseverance, of praying in His Name, of
praying in the will of God. But all these conditions
were summed up in the one central one: &ldquo;<em>If ye abide
in Me</em>, ask whatsoever ye will and it shall be done
unto you.&rdquo; It became clear that the power to pray
the effectual prayer of faith depended <em>upon the life</em>.
It is only to a man given up to live as entirely in
Christ and for Christ as the branch in the vine and
for the vine, that these promises can come true.
&ldquo;<em>In that day</em>,&rdquo; Christ said, the day of Pentecost, &ldquo;ye
shall ask in My Name.&rdquo; It is only in a life full of
the Holy Spirit that the true power to ask in Christ&#8217;s
Name can be known. This led to the emphasising
the truth that the ordinary Christian life cannot
appropriate these promises. It needs a spiritual life,
altogether sound and vigorous, to pray in power. The
teaching naturally led to press the need of a life of
entire consecration. More than one has told me how
it was in the reading of the book that he first saw
what the better life was that could be lived, and
must be lived, if Christ&#8217;s wonderful promises are to
come true to us.</p>

<p>In regard to these two truths there is no change
in the present volume. One only wishes that one
could put them with such clearness and force as to
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">4</span><span class="ns">] </span>
help every beloved fellow-Christian to some right
impression of the reality and the glory of our
privilege as God&#8217;s children: &ldquo;Ask whatsoever ye
will, and it shall be done unto you.&rdquo; The present
volume owes its existence to the desire to enforce
two truths, of which formerly I had no such impression
as now.</p>

<p>The one is&mdash;that Christ actually meant prayer
to be the great power by which His Church should
do its work, and that the neglect of prayer is the
great reason the Church has not greater power over
the masses in Christian and in heathen countries.
In the first chapter I have stated how my convictions
in regard to this have been strengthened, and
what gave occasion to the writing of the book. It
is meant to be, on behalf of myself and my brethren
in the ministry and all God&#8217;s people, a confession
of shortcoming and of sin, and, at the same time, a
call to believe that things can be different, and that
Christ waits to fit us by His Spirit to pray as He
would have us. This call, of course, brings me
back to what I spoke of in connection with the
former volume: that there is a life in the Spirit, a
life of abiding in Christ, within our reach, in which
the power of prayer&mdash;both the power to pray and
the power to obtain the answer&mdash;can be realised in
a measure which we could not have thought possible
before. Any failure in the prayer-life, any desire
<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">5</span><span class="ns">] </span>
or hope really to take the place Christ has prepared
for us, brings us to the very root of the doctrine of
grace as manifested in the Christian life. It is only
by a full surrender to the life of abiding, by the
yielding to the fulness of the Spirit&#8217;s leading and
quickening, that the prayer-life can be restored to a
truly healthy state. I feel deeply how little I have
been able to put this in the volume as I could wish.
I have prayed and am trusting that God, who
chooses the weak things, will use it for His own glory.</p>

<p>The second truth which I have sought to enforce
is that we have far too little conception of the place
that intercession, as distinguished from prayer for
ourselves, ought to have in the Church and the
Christian life. In intercession our King upon the
throne finds His highest glory; in it we shall find
our highest glory too. Through it He continues
His saving work, and can do nothing without it;
through it alone we can do our work, and nothing
avails without it. In it He ever receives from the
Father the Holy Spirit and all spiritual blessings to
impart; in it we too are called to receive in ourselves
the fulness of God&#8217;s Spirit, with the power to
impart spiritual blessing to others. The power of
the Church truly to bless rests on intercession&mdash;asking
and receiving heavenly gifts to carry to men.
Because this is so, it is no wonder that where,
owing to lack of teaching or spiritual insight,
<ins class="TN" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: original reads &lsquo;we the trust&rsquo;">we</ins>
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">6</span><span class="ns">] </span>
<ins class="TN" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: original reads &lsquo;we the trust&rsquo;">trust</ins>
in our own diligence and effort, to the
influence of the world and the flesh, and work more
than we pray, the presence and power of God are
not seen in our work as we would wish.</p>

<p>Such thoughts have led me to wonder what could
be done to rouse believers to a sense of their high
calling in this, and to help and train them to take
part in it. And so this book differs from the former
one in the attempt to open a practising school, and
to invite all who have never taken systematic part
in the great work of intercession to begin and give
themselves to it. There are tens of thousands of
workers who have known and are proving wonderfully
what prayer can do. But there are tens of
thousands who work with but little prayer, and as
many more who do not work because they do not
know how or where, who might all be won to swell
the host of intercessors who are to bring down the
blessings of heaven to earth. For their sakes, and
the sake of all who feel the need of help, I have prepared
helps and hints for a school of intercession
for a month (see the Appendix). I have asked
those who would join, to begin by giving at least
ten minutes a day definitely to this work. It is in
doing that we learn to do; it is as we take hold
and begin that the help of God&#8217;s Spirit will come.
It is as we daily hear God&#8217;s call, and at once put it
into practice, that the consciousness will begin to
<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">7</span><span class="ns">] </span>
live in us, I too am an intercessor; and that we
shall feel the need of living in Christ and being
full of the Spirit if we are to do this work aright.
Nothing will so test and stimulate the Christian
life as the honest attempt to be an intercessor. It
is difficult to conceive how much we ourselves and
the Church will be the gainers, if with our whole
heart we accept the post of honour God is offering
us. With regard to the school of intercession, I am
confident that the result of the first month&#8217;s course
will be to awake the feeling of how little we know how
to intercede. And a second and a third month may
only deepen the sense of ignorance and unfitness.
This will be an unspeakable blessing. The confession,
&ldquo;We know not how to pray as we ought,&rdquo; is the
introduction to the experience, &ldquo;The Spirit maketh
intercession for us&rdquo;&mdash;our sense of ignorance will
lead us to depend upon the Spirit praying in us,
to feel the need of living in the Spirit.</p>

<p>We have heard a great deal of systematic Bible
study, and we praise God for thousands on thousands
of Bible classes and Bible readings. Let all the
leaders of such classes see whether they could not
open prayer classes&mdash;helping their students to pray
in secret, and training them to be, above everything,
men of prayer. Let ministers ask what they can
do in this. The faith in God&#8217;s word can nowhere
be so exercised and perfected as in the intercession
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">8</span><span class="ns">] </span>
that asks and expects and looks out for the answer.
Throughout Scripture, in the life of every saint, of
God&#8217;s own Son, throughout the history of God&#8217;s
Church, God is, first of all, a prayer-hearing God.
Let us try and help God&#8217;s children to know their
God, and encourage all God&#8217;s servants to labour with
the assurance: the chief and most blessed part of
my work is to ask and receive from my Father
what I can bring to others.</p>

<p>It will now easily be understood how what this
book contains will be nothing but the confirmation
and the call to put into practice the two great
lessons of the former one. &ldquo;<em>Ask whatsoever ye will,
and it shall be done to you</em>&rdquo;; &ldquo;<em>Whatever ye ask,
believe that ye have received</em>&rdquo;: these great prayer-promises,
as part of the Church&#8217;s enduement of
power for her work, are to be taken as literally and
actually true. &ldquo;<em>If ye abide in Me, and My words
abide in you</em>&rdquo;; &ldquo;<em>In that day ye shall ask in My
Name</em>&rdquo;: these great prayer-conditions are universal
and unchangeable. A life abiding in Christ and
filled with the Spirit, a life entirely given up as a
branch for the work of the vine, has the power to
claim these promises and to pray the effectual prayer
that availeth much. Lord, teach us to pray.</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="start">At</span> our last Wellington Convention for the
Deepening of the Spiritual Life, in April,
the forenoon meetings were devoted to prayer and
intercession. Great blessing was found, both in
listening to what the Word teaches of their need
and power, and in joining in continued united
supplication. Many felt that we know too little
of persevering importunate prayer, and that it is
indeed one of the greatest needs of the Church.</p>

<p>During the past two months I have been attending
a number of Conventions. At the first, a
<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">10</span><span class="ns">] </span>
Dutch Missionary Conference at Langlaagte,
Prayer had been chosen as the subject of the
addresses. At the next, at Johannesburg, a
brother in business gave expression to his deep
conviction that the great want of the Church of our
day was, more of the spirit and practice of intercession.
A week later we had a Dutch Ministerial
Conference in the Free State, where three days
were spent, after two days&#8217; services in the congregation
on the work of the Holy Spirit, in
considering the relation of the Spirit to prayer.
At the ministerial meetings held at most of the
succeeding conventions, we were led to take up the
subject, and everywhere there was the confession:
We pray too little! And with this there appeared
to be a fear that, with the pressure of duty and
the force of habit, it was almost impossible to hope
for any great change.</p>

<p>I cannot say what a deep impression was made
upon me by these conversations. Most of all, by
the thought that there should be anything like
hopelessness on the part of God&#8217;s servants as to the
prospect of an entire change being effected, and
real deliverance found from a failure which cannot
but hinder our own joy in God, and our power in
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">11</span><span class="ns">] </span>
His service. And I prayed God to give me words
that might not only help to direct attention to the
evil, but, specially, that might stir up faith, and
waken the assurance that God by His Spirit will
enable us to pray as we ought.</p>

<p>Let me begin, for the sake of those who have
never had their attention directed to the matter,
by stating some of the facts that prove how
universal is the sense of shortcoming in this
respect.</p>

<p>Last year there appeared a report of an address
to ministers by Dr. Whyte, of Free St. George&#8217;s,
Edinburgh. In that he said that, as a young
minister, he had thought that, of the time he had
over from pastoral visitation, he ought to spend as
much as possible with his books in his study. He
wanted to feed his people with the very best he
could prepare for them. But he had now learned
that prayer was of more importance than study.
He reminded his brethren of the election of deacons
to take charge of the collections, that the twelve
might &ldquo;give themselves to prayer and the ministry
of the word,&rdquo; and said that at times, when the
deacons brought him his salary, he had to ask
himself whether he had been as faithful in his
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">12</span><span class="ns">] </span>
engagement as the deacons had been to theirs. He
felt as if it were almost too late to regain what he
had lost, and urged his brethren to pray more.
What a solemn confession and warning from one of
the high places: We pray too little!</p>

<p>During the Regent Square Convention two years
ago the subject came up in conversation with a
well-known London minister. He urged that if
so much time must be given to prayer, it would
involve the neglect of the imperative calls of duty
&ldquo;There is the morning post, before breakfast, with
ten or twelve letters which <em>must</em> be answered.
Then there are committee meetings waiting, with
numberless other engagements, more than enough to
fill up the day. It is difficult to see how it can be
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My answer was, in substance, that it was simply
a question of whether the call of God for our time
and attention was of more importance than that of
man. If God was waiting to meet us, and to give
us blessing and power from heaven for His work, it
was a short-sighted policy to put other work in the
place which God and waiting on Him should have.</p>

<p>At one of our ministerial meetings, the superintendent
of a large district put the case thus: &ldquo;I rise
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">13</span><span class="ns">] </span>
in the morning and have half an hour with God, in
the Word and prayer, in my room before breakfast.
I go out, and am occupied all day with a multiplicity
of engagements. I do not think many minutes
elapse without my breathing a prayer for guidance
or help. After my day&#8217;s work, I return in my
evening devotions and speak to God of the day&#8217;s
work. But of the intense, definite, importunate
prayer of which Scripture speaks one knows little.&rdquo;
What, he asked, must I think of such a life?</p>

<p>We all know the difference between a man whose
profits are just enough to maintain his family and
keep up his business, and another whose income enables
him to extend the business and to help others.
There may be an earnest Christian life in which
there is prayer enough to keep us from going back,
and just maintain the position we have attained to,
without much of growth in spirituality or Christlikeness.
The attitude is more defensive, seeking
to ward off temptation, than aggressive, reaching
out after higher attainment. If there is indeed to
be a going from strength to strength, with some
large experience of God&#8217;s power to sanctify ourselves
and to bring down real blessing on others,
there must be more definite and persevering
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">14</span><span class="ns">] </span>
prayer. The Scripture teaching about crying day
and night, continuing steadfastly in prayer, watching
unto prayer, being heard for his importunity,
must in some degree become our experience if we
are really to be intercessors.</p>

<p>At the very next Convention the same question
was put in somewhat different form. &ldquo;I am at
the head of a station, with a large outlying district
to care for. I see the importance of much prayer,
and yet my life hardly leaves room for it. Are we
to submit? Or tell us how we can attain to what
we desire?&rdquo; I admitted that the difficulty was
universal. I recalled the words of one of our most
honoured South African missionaries, now gone to
his rest: he had the same complaint. &ldquo;In the
morning at five the sick people are at the door
waiting for medicine. At six the printers come,
and I have to set them to work and teach them.
At nine the school calls me, and till late at night
I am kept busy with a large correspondence.&rdquo; In
my answer I quoted a Dutch proverb: &lsquo;What <em>is</em>
heaviest must <em>weigh</em> heaviest,&rsquo;&mdash;must have the first
place. The law of God is unchangeable: as on
earth, so in our traffic with heaven, we only get as
we give. Unless we are willing to pay the price,
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">15</span><span class="ns">] </span>
and sacrifice time and attention and what appear
legitimate or necessary duties, for the sake of the
heavenly gifts, we need not look for a large experience
of the power of the heavenly world in our
work. The whole company present joined in the
sad confession; it had been thought over, and
mourned over, times without number; and yet, somehow,
there they were, all these pressing claims, and
all the ineffectual resolves to pray more, barring
the way. I need not now say to what further
thoughts our conversation led; the substance of
them will be found in some of the later chapters
in this volume.</p>

<p>Let me call just one more witness. In the
course of my journey I met with one of the Cowley
Fathers, who had just been holding Retreats for
clergy of the English Church. I was interested to
hear from him the line of teaching he follows. In
the course of conversation he used the expression&mdash;&ldquo;the
distraction of business,&rdquo; and it came out that
he found it one of the great difficulties he had to
deal with in himself and others. Of himself, he
said that by the vows of his Order he was bound
to give himself specially to prayer. But he found
it exceedingly difficult. Every day he had to be at
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">16</span><span class="ns">] </span>
four different points of the town he lived in; his
predecessor had left him the charge of a number
of committees where he was expected to do all the
work; it was as if everything conspired to keep
him from prayer.</p>

<p>All this testimony surely suffices to make clear
that prayer has not the place it ought to have in
our ministerial and Christian life; that the shortcoming
is one of which all are willing to make
confession; and that the difficulties in the way of
deliverance are such as to make a return to a true
and full prayer-life almost impossible. Blessed be
God&mdash;&ldquo;The things that are impossible with men
are possible with God&rdquo;! &ldquo;God is able to make all
grace abound toward you, that ye, always having
all sufficiency in all things, may abound to all good
work.&rdquo; Do let us believe that God&#8217;s call to
much prayer need not be a burden and cause of
continual self-condemnation. He means it to be a
joy. He can make it an inspiration, giving us
strength for all our work, and bringing down His
power to work through us in our fellowmen. Let
us not fear to admit to the full the sin that shames
us, and then to face it in the name of our Mighty
Redeemer. <em>The light that shows us our sin and
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">17</span><span class="ns">] </span>
condemns us for it, will show us the way out of it,
into the life of liberty that is well-pleasing to God.</em>
If we allow this one matter, unfaithfulness in
prayer, to convict us of the lack in our Christian
life which lies at the root of it, God will use the
discovery to bring us not only the power to pray
that we long for, but the joy of a new and healthy
life, of which prayer is the spontaneous expression.</p>

<p>And what is now the way by which our sense of
the lack of prayer can be made the means of blessing,
the entrance on a path in which the evil may
be conquered? How can our intercourse with the
Father, in continual prayer and intercession, become
what it ought to be, if we and the world around us
are to be blessed? As it appears to me, we must
begin by going back to God&#8217;s Word, to study what
<em>the place is God means prayer to have</em> in the life
of His child and His Church. A fresh sight of
what prayer is <em>according to the will of God</em>, of what
our prayers can be, <em>through the grace of God</em>, will
free us from those feeble defective views, in regard
to the absolute necessity of continual prayer, which
lie at the root of our failure. As we get an insight
into the reasonableness and rightness of this divine
appointment, and come under the full conviction of
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">18</span><span class="ns">] </span>
how wonderfully it fits in with God&#8217;s love and our
own happiness, we shall be freed from the false
impression of its being an arbitrary demand. We
shall with our whole heart and soul consent to it
and rejoice in it, as the one only possible way for
the blessing of heaven to come to earth. All
thought of task and burden, of self-effort and strain,
will pass away in the blessed faith that as simple
as breathing is in the healthy natural life, will
praying be in the Christian life that is led and
filled by the Spirit of God.</p>

<p>As we occupy ourselves with and accept this
teaching of God&#8217;s Word on prayer, we shall be led
to see how our failure in the prayer-life was owing
to failure in the Spirit-life. Prayer is one of the
most heavenly and spiritual of the functions of the
Spirit-life. How could we try or expect to fulfil it
so as to please God, except as our soul is in
perfect health, and our life truly possessed and
moved by God&#8217;s Spirit? The insight into the place
God means prayer to take, and which it only can
take, in a full Christian life, will show us that
we have not been living the true, the abundant
life, and that any thought of praying more and
effectually will be vain, except as we are brought
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">19</span><span class="ns">] </span>
into a closer relation to our Blessed Lord Jesus.
Christ is our life, Christ liveth in us, in such reality
that His life of prayer on earth, and of intercession
in heaven, is breathed into us in just such measure
as our surrender and our faith allow and accept it.
Jesus Christ is the Healer of all diseases, the Conqueror
of all enemies, the Deliverer from all sin; if
our failure teaches us to turn afresh to Him,
and find in Him the grace He gives to pray as we
ought, this humiliation may become our greatest
blessing. Let us all unite in praying God that He
would visit our souls and fit us for that work of
intercession, which is at this moment the greatest
need of the Church and the world. It is only by intercession
that that power can be brought down from
Heaven which will enable the Church to conquer
the world. Let us stir up the slumbering gift that
is lying unused, and seek to gather and train and
band together as many as we can, to be God&#8217;s
remembrancers, and to give Him no rest till He
makes His Church a joy in the earth. Nothing
but intense believing prayer can meet the intense
spirit of worldliness, of which complaint is everywhere
made.</p>

<div class="epigraph"><p>&ldquo;If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your
children; how much more shall your Heavenly Father give the
Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smc">Luke</span> xi.&nbsp;13.</p></div>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="start">Christ</span> had just said (v.&nbsp;9), &ldquo;Ask, and it shall be
given&rdquo;: God&#8217;s giving is inseparably connected
with our asking. He applies this especially to the
Holy Spirit. As surely as a father on earth gives
bread to his child, so God gives the Holy Spirit to
them that ask Him. The whole ministration of the
Spirit is ruled by the one great law: God must
give, we must ask. When the Holy Spirit was
poured out at Pentecost with a flow that never ceases,
it was in answer to prayer. The inflow into the
believer&#8217;s heart, and His outflow in the rivers of
living water, ever still depend upon the law: &ldquo;Ask,
and it shall be given.&rdquo; In connection with our
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">21</span><span class="ns">] </span>
confession of the lack of prayer, we have said that
what we need is some due apprehension of the
place it occupies in God&#8217;s plan of redemption; we
shall perhaps nowhere see this more clearly than in
the first half of the Acts of the Apostles. The
story of the birth of the Church in the outpouring
of the Holy Spirit, and of the first freshness of its
heavenly life in the power of that Spirit, will teach
us how <em>prayer on earth</em>, whether as cause or effect,
<em>is the true measure of the presence of the Spirit of
heaven</em>.</p>

<p>We begin with the well-known words (i.&nbsp;13),
&ldquo;These all continued with one accord in prayer and
supplication.&rdquo; And then there follows: &ldquo;And
when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they
were all with one accord in one place. And they
were all filled with the Holy Ghost. And the
same day there were added to them about three
thousand souls.&rdquo; The great work of redemption
had been accomplished. The Holy Spirit had been
promised by Christ &ldquo;not many days hence.&rdquo; He
had sat down on His throne and received the Spirit
from the Father. But all this was not enough.
One thing more was needed: the ten days&#8217; united
continued supplication of the disciples. It was
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">22</span><span class="ns">] </span>
intense, continued prayer that prepared the disciples&#8217;
hearts, that opened the windows of heaven, that
brought down the promised gift. As little as
the power of the Spirit could be given without
Christ sitting on the throne, <em>could it descend without
the disciples on the footstool of the throne</em>. For all the
ages the law is laid down here, at the birth of the
Church, that whatever else may be found on earth,
the power of the Spirit must be prayed down from
heaven. The measure of believing, continued prayer
will be the measure of the Spirit&#8217;s working in
the Church. Direct, definite, determined prayer is
what we need.</p>

<p>See how this is confirmed in chapter iv. Peter
and John had been brought before the Council and
threatened with punishment. When they returned
to their brethren, and reported what had been said
to them, &ldquo;all lifted up their voice to God with one
accord,&rdquo; and prayed for boldness to speak the word.
&ldquo;And when they had prayed, the place was shaken,
and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and
they spake the word of God with boldness. And
the multitude of them that believed were one heart
and one soul. And with great power gave the
apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">23</span><span class="ns">] </span>
Jesus; and great grace was upon them all.&rdquo; It is
as if the story of Pentecost is repeated a second
time over, with the prayer, the shaking of the house,
the filling with the Spirit, the speaking God&#8217;s word
with boldness and power, the great grace upon
all, the manifestation of unity and love&mdash;to imprint
it ineffaceably on the heart of the Church: it is
prayer that lies at the root of the spiritual life and
power of the Church. The measure of God&#8217;s giving
the Spirit is our asking. He gives as a father to
him who asks as a child.</p>

<p>Go on to the sixth chapter. There we find that,
when murmurings arose as to the neglect of the
Grecian Jews in the distribution of alms, the
apostles proposed the appointment of deacons to
serve the tables. &ldquo;We,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;will give ourselves
to prayer and the ministry of the word.&rdquo;
It is often said, and rightly said, that there is
nothing in honest business, when it is kept in its
place as entirely subordinate to the kingdom, which
must ever be first, that need prevent fellowship
with God. Least of all ought a work like ministering
to the poor hinder the spiritual life. And yet
the apostles felt it would hinder them in their giving
themselves to the ministry of prayer and the word.
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">24</span><span class="ns">] </span>
What does this teach? That the maintenance of
the spirit of prayer, such as is consistent with the
claims of much work, is not enough for those who
are the leaders of the Church. To keep up the communication
with the King on the throne and the
heavenly world clear and fresh; to draw down the
power and blessing of that world, not only for the
maintenance of our own spiritual life, but for those
around us; continually to receive instruction and
empowerment for the great work to be done&mdash;the
apostles, as the ministers of the word, felt the need
of being free from other duties, that they might
give themselves to much prayer. James writes:
&ldquo;Pure religion and undefiled before God and the
Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows
in their affliction.&rdquo; If ever any work were a sacred
one, it was that of caring for these Grecian widows.
And yet, even such duties might interfere with the
special calling to give themselves to prayer and the
ministry of the word. As on earth, so in the
kingdom of heaven, there is power in the division
of labour; and while some, like the deacons, had
specially to care for serving the tables and ministering
the alms of the Church here on earth, others
had to be set free for that steadfast continuance in
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">25</span><span class="ns">] </span>
prayer which would uninterruptedly secure the
downflow of the powers of the heavenly world. The
minister of Christ is set apart to give himself as
much to prayer as to the ministry of the word.
In faithful obedience to this law is the secret of
the Church&#8217;s power and success. As before, so
<em>after Pentecost</em>, the apostles were men given up to
prayer.</p>

<p>In chapter viii. we have the intimate connection
between the Pentecostal gift and prayer, from
another point of view. At Samaria, Philip had
preached with great blessing, and many had believed.
But the Holy Ghost was, as yet, fallen on
none of them. The apostles sent down Peter and
John to pray for them, that they might receive the
Holy Ghost. The power for such prayer was a
higher gift than preaching&mdash;the work of the men
who had been in closest contact with the Lord
in glory, the work that was essential to the perfection
of the life that preaching and baptism,
faith and conversion had only begun. Surely of
all the gifts of the early Church for which we
should long there is none more needed than the
gift of prayer&mdash;prayer that brings down the Holy
Ghost on believers. This power is given to the
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">26</span><span class="ns">] </span>
men who say: &ldquo;We will give ourselves to
prayer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, in the
house of Cornelius at Cæsarea, we have another
testimony to the wondrous interdependence of the
action of prayer and the Spirit, and another proof of
what will come to a man who has given himself to
prayer. Peter went up at midday to pray on the
housetop. And what happened? He saw heaven
opened, and there came the vision that revealed to
him the cleansing of the Gentiles; with that came
the message of the three men from Cornelius, a man
who &ldquo;prayed alway,&rdquo; and had heard from an angel,
&ldquo;Thy prayers are come up before God&rdquo;; and then
the voice of the Spirit was heard saying, &ldquo;Go with
them.&rdquo; It is Peter praying, to whom the will of
God is revealed, to whom guidance is given as to
going to Cæsarea, and who is brought into contact
with a praying and prepared company of hearers.
No wonder that in answer to all this prayer a
blessing comes beyond all expectation, and the Holy
Ghost is poured out upon the Gentiles. A much-praying
minister will receive an entrance into God&#8217;s
will he would otherwise know nothing of; will be
brought to praying people where he does not expect
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">27</span><span class="ns">] </span>
them; will receive blessing above all he asks or
thinks. The teaching and the power of the Holy
Ghost are alike unalterably linked to prayer.</p>

<p>Our next reference will show us faith in the power
that the Church&#8217;s prayer has with its glorified
King, as it is found, not only in the apostles, but
in the Christian community. In chapter xii.
we have the story of Peter in prison on the eve of
execution. The death of James had aroused the
Church to a sense of real danger, and the thought
of losing Peter too, wakened up all its energies. It
betook itself to prayer. &ldquo;Prayer was made of the
Church without ceasing to God for him.&rdquo; That
prayer availed much; Peter was delivered. When
he came to the house of Mary, he found &ldquo;many
gathered together praying.&rdquo; Stone walls and
double chains, soldiers and keepers, and the iron
gate, all gave way before the power from heaven
that prayer brought down to his rescue. The
whole power of the Roman Empire, as represented
by Herod, was impotent in presence of the power
the Church of the Holy Spirit wielded in prayer.
They stood in such close and living communication
with their Lord in heaven; they knew so well that
the words, &ldquo;all power is given unto Me,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lo I
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">28</span><span class="ns">] </span>
am with you alway,&rdquo; were absolutely true; they had
such faith in His promise to hear them whatever
they asked&mdash;that they prayed in the assurance that
the powers of heaven could work on earth, and
would work at their request and on their behalf.
The Pentecostal Church believed in prayer, and
practised it.</p>

<p>Just one more illustration of the place and the
blessing of prayer among men filled with the Holy
Spirit. In chapter xiii. we have the names of five
men at Antioch who had given themselves specially
to ministering to the Lord with prayer and fasting.
Their giving themselves to prayer was not in vain:
as they ministered to the Lord, the Holy Spirit met
them, and gave them new insight into God&#8217;s plans.
He called them to be fellow-workers with Himself;
there was a work to which He had called Barnabas
and Saul; their part and privilege would be to
separate these men with renewed fasting and prayer,
and to let them go, &ldquo;sent forth of the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;
God in heaven would not send forth His chosen servants
without the co-operation of His Church; men on
earth were to have a real partnership in the work of
God. It was prayer that fitted and prepared them
for this; it was to praying men the Holy Ghost gave
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">29</span><span class="ns">] </span>
authority to do His work and use His name. It was
to prayer the Holy Ghost was given. It is still
prayer that is the only secret of true Church
extension, that is guided from heaven to find and
send forth God-called and God-empowered men.
To prayer the Holy Spirit will show the men He
has selected; to prayer that sets them apart under
His guidance He will give the honour of knowing
that they are men, &ldquo;sent forth by the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;
It is prayer which is the link between the King on
the throne and the Church at His footstool&mdash;the
human link that has its divine strength in the
power of the Holy Ghost, who comes in answer to it.</p>

<p>As one looks back upon these chapters in the
history of the Pentecostal Church, how clear the two
great truths stand out: where there is much prayer
there will be much of the Spirit; where there is
much of the Spirit there will be ever-increasing
prayer. So clear is the living connection between
the two, that when the Spirit is given in answer
to prayer it ever wakens more prayer to prepare
for the fuller revelation and communication of His
Divine power and grace. If prayer was thus the
power by which the Primitive Church flourished
and triumphed, is it not the one need of the
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">30</span><span class="ns">] </span>
Church of our days? Let us learn what ought to
be counted axioms in our Church work:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="padrt">Heaven is still as full of stores of spiritual
blessing as it was then.</span> <span class="padrt">God still delights to
give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him.</span>
<span class="padrt">Our life and work are still as dependent on the
direct impartation of Divine power as they were
in Pentecostal times.</span> <span class="padrt">Prayer is still the appointed
means for drawing down these heavenly
blessings in power on ourselves and those around
us.</span> God still seeks for men and women who
will, with all their other work of ministering,
specially give themselves to persevering prayer.</p>

<p>And we&mdash;you, my reader, and I&mdash;may have the
privilege of offering ourselves to God to labour in
prayer, and bring down these blessings to this earth.
Shall we not beseech God to make all this truth
so living in us that we may not rest till it has
mastered us, and our whole heart be so filled with
it, that the practice of intercession shall be counted
by us our highest privilege, and we find in it the
sure and only measure for blessing on ourselves, on
the Church, and on the world?</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="start">We</span> have seen in our previous chapter what
power prayer has. It is the one power
on earth that commands the power of heaven.
The story of the early days of the Church is
God&#8217;s great object-lesson, to teach His Church
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">32</span><span class="ns">] </span>
what prayer can do, how it alone, but it most
surely, can draw down the treasures and powers
of heaven into the life of earth.</p>

<p>Just remember the lessons we learnt of how
prayer is at once indispensable and irresistible.
Did we not see how unknown and untold power
and blessing is stored up for us in heaven?&mdash;how
that power will make us a blessing to men, and
fit us to do any work or face any danger? how
it is to be sought in prayer continually and
persistently? how they who have the heavenly
power can pray it down upon others? how in all
the intercourse of ministers and people, in all the
ministrations of Christ&#8217;s Church, it is the one
secret of success? how it can defy all the power
of the world, and fit men to conquer that world
for Christ? It is the power of the heavenly life,
the power of God&#8217;s own Spirit, the power of
Omnipotence, that waits for prayer to bring it
down.</p>

<p>In all this prayer there was little thought of
personal need or happiness. It was the desire to
witness for Christ and bring Him and His salvation
to others, it was the thought of God&#8217;s kingdom
and glory, that possessed these disciples. If we
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">33</span><span class="ns">] </span>
would be delivered from the sin of restraining
prayer, we must enlarge our hearts for the work
of intercession. The attempt to pray constantly
for ourselves must be a failure; it is in intercession
for others that our faith and love and perseverance
will be aroused, and that power of the
Spirit be found which can fit us for saving men.
We are asking how we may become more faithful
and successful in prayer; let us see how the
Master teaches us, in the parable of the Friend
at Midnight, that intercession for the needy calls
forth the highest exercise of our power of
believing and prevailing prayer. Intercession is
the most perfect form of prayer: it is the prayer
Christ ever liveth to pray on His throne. Let
us learn what the elements of true intercession
are.</p>

<p>1. Notice <em>the urgent need</em>: here intercession
has its origin. The friend came at midnight&mdash;an
untimely hour. He was hungry, and could
not buy bread. If we are to learn to pray
aright we must open eye and heart to the need
around us.</p>

<p>We hear continually of the thousand millions
of heathen and Mohammedans living in midnight
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">34</span><span class="ns">] </span>
darkness, perishing for lack of the bread of life.
We hear of five hundred millions of nominal
Christians, the great majority of them almost
as ignorant and indifferent as the heathen. We
see millions in the Christian Church, not ignorant
or indifferent, and yet knowing little of a walk in
the light of God or in the power of a life fed by
bread from heaven. We have each of us our own
circles&mdash;congregations, schools, friends, missions&mdash;in
which the great complaint is that the light and
life of God are too little known. Surely, if we
believe what we profess, that God alone is able to
help, that God certainly will help in answer to
prayer,&mdash;all this need ought to make intercessors
of us, people who give their lives to prayer for
those around them.</p>

<p>Let us take time to consider and realise the
need. Each Christless soul going down into outer
darkness, perishing of hunger, with bread enough
and to spare! Thirty millions a year dying without
the knowledge of Christ! Our own neighbours and
friends, souls intrusted to us, dying without hope!
Christians around us living a sickly, feeble, fruitless
life! Surely there is need for prayer. Nothing,
nothing but prayer to God for help, will avail.</p>

<p><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">35</span><span class="ns">] </span>
2. Note <em>the willing love</em>.&mdash;The friend took his
weary, hungry friend into his house, and into his
heart too. He did not excuse himself by saying
he had no bread: he gave himself at midnight to
seek it for him. He sacrificed his night&#8217;s rest, his
comfort, to find the needed bread. &ldquo;Love seeketh
not its own.&rdquo; It is the very nature of love to give
up and forget itself for the sake of others. It
takes their needs and makes them its own, it finds
its real joy in living and dying for others as
Christ did.</p>

<p>It is the love of a mother to her prodigal son
that makes her pray for him. True love to souls
will become in us the spirit of intercession. It is
possible to do a great deal of faithful, earnest work
for our fellowmen without true love to them.
Just as a lawyer or a physician, from a love of
his profession and a high sense of faithfulness to
duty, may interest himself most thoroughly in
clients or patients without any special love to each,
so servants of Christ may give themselves to their
work with devotion and even self-sacrificing enthusiasm
without the Christlike love to souls being
strong. It is this lack of love that causes so
much shortcoming in prayer. It is as love of our
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">36</span><span class="ns">] </span>
profession and work, delight in thoroughness and
diligence, sink away in the tender compassion of
Christ, that love will compel us to prayer, because
we cannot rest in our work if souls are not
saved. True love must pray.</p>

<p>3. Note <em>the sense of impotence</em>.&mdash;We often
speak of the power of love. In one sense this is
true; and yet the truth has its limitations, which
must not be forgotten. The strongest love may be
utterly impotent. A mother might be willing to
give her life for her dying child, and yet not be
able to save it. The friend at midnight was most
willing to give his friend bread, but he had none.
It was this sense of impotence, of his inability to
help, that sent him a-begging: &ldquo;My friend is come
to me, and <em>I have nothing</em> to set before him.&rdquo; It
is this sense of impotence with God&#8217;s servants that
is the very strength of the life of intercession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to set before them&rdquo;: as this
consciousness takes possession of the minister or
missionary, the teacher or worker, intercession will
become their only hope and refuge. I may have
knowledge and truth, a loving heart, and the
readiness to give myself for those under my charge;
but the bread of heaven I cannot give them. With
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">37</span><span class="ns">] </span>
all my love and zeal, &ldquo;I have nothing to set before
them.&rdquo; Blessed the man who has made that &ldquo;I
have nothing,&rdquo; the motto of his ministry. As he
thinks of the judgment day and the danger of
souls, as he sees what a supernatural power and life
is needed to save men from sin, as he feels how
utterly insufficient all he can ever do is to give
them life, that &ldquo;<em>I have nothing</em>&rdquo; urges him to pray.
Intercession appears to him, as he thinks of the
midnight darkness and the hungry souls, as his
only hope, the one thing in which his love can take
refuge.</p>

<p>Let us take the lesson to heart, for a warning
to all who are strong and wise to work, for the
encouragement of all who are feeble. The sense
of our impotence is the soul of intercession. The
simplest, feeblest Christian can pray down blessing
from an Almighty God.</p>

<p>4. Note <em>the faith in prayer</em>.&mdash;What he has not
himself, another can supply. He has a rich friend
near, who will be both able and willing to give the
bread. He is sure that if he only asks, he will
receive. This faith makes him leave his home at
midnight: if he has not the bread himself to give,
he can ask another.</p>

<p><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">38</span><span class="ns">] </span>
It is this simple, confident faith that God will
give, that we need: where it really exists, there
will surely be no mistake about our not praying.
And in God&#8217;s word we have everything that can
stir and strengthen such faith in us. Just as
the heaven our natural eye can see is one great
ocean of sunshine, with its light and heat, giving
beauty and fruitfulness to earth, Scripture shows
us God&#8217;s true heaven, filled with all spiritual blessings,&mdash;divine
light and love and life, heavenly joy
and peace and power, all shining down upon us.
It reveals to us God waiting, delighting to bestow
these blessings <em>in answer to prayer</em>. By a thousand
promises and testimonies it calls and urges us to
believe that prayer will be heard, that what we
cannot possibly do ourselves for those whom
we want to help, <em>can be got by prayer</em>. Surely
there can be no question as to our believing that
prayer will be heard, that through prayer the
poorest and feeblest can dispense blessings to
the needy, and each of us, though poor, may yet
be making many rich.</p>

<p>5. Note <em>the importunity that prevails</em>.&mdash;The
faith of the friend met a sudden and unexpected
check: the rich friend refuses to hear&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot
<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">39</span><span class="ns">] </span>
rise and give thee.&rdquo; How little the loving heart
had counted on this disappointment; it cannot
consent to accept it. The supplicant presses his
threefold plea: here is my needy friend, you have
abundance, I am your friend; and refuses to accept
a denial. The love that opened his house at midnight,
and then left it to seek help, must win.</p>

<p>This is the central lesson of the parable. In our
intercession we may find that there is difficulty
and delay with the answer. It may be as if God
says, &ldquo;I cannot give thee.&rdquo; It is not easy, against
all appearances, to hold fast our confidence that He
will hear, and to persevere in full assurance that we
shall have what we ask. And yet this is what
God looks for from us. He so highly prizes our
confidence in Him, it is so essentially the highest
honour the creature can render the Creator, that
He will do anything to train us in the exercise
of this trust in Him. Blessed the man who
is not staggered by God&#8217;s delay, or silence, or
apparent refusal, but is strong in faith, giving
glory to God. Such faith perseveres, importunately,
if need be, and cannot fail to inherit the
blessing.</p>

<p>6. Note, last, <em>the certainty of a rich reward</em>.&mdash;&ldquo;I
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">40</span><span class="ns">] </span>
say unto you, because of his importunity, he will
give him as many as he needeth.&rdquo; Oh that we
might learn to believe in the certainty of an
abundant answer. A prophet said of old: &ldquo;Let
not your hands be weak; <em>your work shall be
rewarded</em>.&rdquo; Would that all who feel it difficult to
pray much, would fix their eye on the recompense
of the reward, and in faith learn to count upon
the Divine assurance that their prayer cannot be
vain. If we will but believe in God and His
faithfulness, intercession will become to us the
very first thing we take refuge in when we seek
blessing for others, and the very last thing for
which we cannot find time. And it will become
a thing of joy and hope, because, all the time we
pray, we know that we are sowing seed that will
bring forth fruit an hundredfold. Disappointment
is impossible: &ldquo;I say unto you, He will rise and
give him as many as he needeth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let all lovers of souls, and all workers in the
service of the gospel, take courage. Time spent
in prayer will yield more than that given to work.
Prayer alone gives work its worth and its success.
Prayer opens the way for God Himself to do His
work in us and through us. Let our chief work,
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">41</span><span class="ns">] </span>
as God&#8217;s messengers, be intercession: in it we
secure the presence and power of God to go
with us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which of you shall have a friend at midnight,
and shall say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves?&rdquo;
This friend is none other but our God. Do let us
learn that in the darkness of midnight, at the
most unlikely time, and in the greatest need, when
we have to say of those we love and care for, &ldquo;I
have nothing to set before them,&rdquo; we have a rich
Friend in heaven, the Everlasting God and Father,
who only waits to be asked aright. Let us confess
before Him our lack of prayer. Let us admit
that the lack of faith, of which it is the proof, is
the symptom of a life that is not spiritual, that
is yet all too much under the power of self and
the flesh and the world. Let us in the faith of
the Lord Jesus, who spake this parable, and Himself
waits to make every trait of it true in us,
give ourselves to be intercessors. Let every sight
of souls needing help, let every stirring of the
spirit of compassion, let every sense of our own
impotence to bless, let every difficulty in the way
of our getting an answer, just combine to urge
us to do this one thing: with importunity to
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">42</span><span class="ns">] </span>
cry to the God who alone can help, who, in
answer to our prayer, will help. And let us, if
we indeed feel that we have failed, do our utmost
to train a young generation of Christians, who
profit by our mistake and avoid it. Moses could
not enter the land of Canaan, but there was one
thing he could do: he could at God&#8217;s bidding
&ldquo;charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen
him&rdquo; (Deut. iii.&nbsp;28). If it is too late for us to
make good our failure, let us at least encourage
those who come after us to enter into the good
land, the blessed life of unceasing prayer.</p>

<p>The Model Intercessor is the Model Christian
Worker. First to get from God, and then to give
to men what we ourselves secure from day to day,
is the secret of successful work. Between our
Impotence and God&#8217;s Omnipotence intercession is
the blessed link.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And He spake a parable unto them, to the end, they ought
always to pray and not to faint.... Hear what the unrighteous
judge saith. And shall not God avenge His own elect, which
<em>cry to Him day and night</em>, and <em>He is long-suffering with them</em>?
I tell you that He will avenge them speedily.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smc">Luke</span> xviii. 1&ndash;8.</p></div>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="start">Our</span> Lord Jesus thought it of such importance
that we should know the need of perseverance
and importunity in prayer, that He spake two
parables to teach us this. This is proof sufficient
that in this aspect of prayer we have at once its
greatest difficulty and its highest power. He would
have us know that in prayer all will not be easy
and smooth; we must expect difficulties, which
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">44</span><span class="ns">] </span>
can only be conquered by persistent, determined
perseverance.</p>

<p>In the parables our Lord represents the difficulty
as existing on the side of the persons to whom
the petition was addressed, and the importunity
as needed to overcome their reluctance to hear.
In our intercourse with God the difficulty is not
on His side, but on ours. In connection with the
first parable He tells us that our Father is more
willing to give good things to those who ask Him
than any earthly father to give his child bread. In
the second, He assures us that God longs to avenge
His elect speedily. The need of urgent prayer
cannot be because God must be made willing
or disposed to bless: the need lies altogether in
ourselves. But because it was not possible to find
any earthly illustration of a loving father or a
willing friend from whom the needed lesson of
importunity could be taught, He takes the unwilling
friend and the unjust judge to encourage
in us the faith, that perseverance can overcome
every obstacle.</p>

<p>The difficulty is not in God&#8217;s love or power, but
in ourselves and our own incapacity to receive the
blessing. And yet, because there is this difficulty
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">45</span><span class="ns">] </span>
with us, this lack of spiritual preparedness, there is
a difficulty with God too. His wisdom, His righteousness,
yea His love, dare not give us what
would do us harm, if we received it too soon or
too easily. The sin, or the consequence of sin, that
makes it impossible for God to give at once, is a
barrier on God&#8217;s side as well as ours; to break
through this power of sin in ourselves, or those
for whom we pray, is what makes the striving and
the conflict of prayer such a reality. And so in
all ages men have prayed, and that rightly too,
under a sense that there were difficulties in the
heavenly world to overcome. As they pleaded
with God for the removal of the unknown obstacles,
and in that persevering supplication were brought
into a state of utter brokenness and helplessness,
of entire resignation to Him, of union with His will,
and of faith that could take hold of Him, the
hindrances in themselves and in heaven were
together overcome. As God conquered them, they
conquered God. As God prevails over us, we
prevail with God.</p>

<p>God has so constituted us that the clearer our
insight is into the reasonableness of a demand, the
more hearty will be our surrender to it. One great
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">46</span><span class="ns">] </span>
cause of our remissness in prayer is that there
appears to be something arbitrary, or at least something
incomprehensible, in the call to such
continued prayer. If we could be brought to see
that this apparent difficulty is a Divine necessity,
and in the very nature of things the source of
unspeakable blessing, we should be more ready
with gladness of heart to give ourselves to continue
in prayer. Let us see if we cannot understand
how the difficulty that the call to importunity
throws in our way is one of our greatest privileges.</p>

<p>I do not know whether you have ever noticed
what a part difficulties play in our natural life.
They call out man&#8217;s powers as nothing else can.
They strengthen and ennoble character. We are
told that one reason of the superiority of the
Northern nations, like Holland and Scotland, in
strength of will and purpose, over those of the
sunny South, as Italy and Spain, is that the
climate of the latter has been too beautiful, and
the life it encourages too easy and relaxing&mdash;the
difficulties the former had to contend with have
been their greatest boon; how all nature has been
so arranged by God that in sowing and reaping,
as in seeking coal or gold, nothing is found without
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">47</span><span class="ns">] </span>
labour and effort. What is education but a daily
developing and disciplining of the mind by new
difficulties presented to the pupil to overcome?
The moment a lesson has become easy, the pupil
is moved on to one that is higher and more
difficult. With the race and the individual, it is
in the meeting and the mastering of difficulties
that our highest attainments are found.</p>

<p>It is even so in our intercourse with God. Just
imagine what the result would be if the child of
God had only to kneel down and ask, and get, and
go away. What unspeakable loss to the spiritual
life would ensue. It is in the difficulty and delay
that calls for persevering prayer, that the true
blessing and blessedness of the heavenly life will
be found. We there learn how little we delight in
fellowship with God, and how little we have of
living faith in Him. We discover how earthly
and unspiritual our heart still is, how little we
have of God&#8217;s Holy Spirit. We there are brought
to know our own weakness and unworthiness, and
to yield to God&#8217;s Spirit to pray in us, to take our
place in Christ Jesus, and abide in Him as our
only plea with the Father. There our own will
and strength and goodness are crucified. There we
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">48</span><span class="ns">] </span>
rise in Christ to newness of life, with our whole
will dependent on God and set upon His glory.
Do let us begin to praise God for the need and the
difficulty of importunate prayer, as one of His
choicest means of grace.</p>

<p>Just think what our Lord Jesus owed to the
difficulties in His path. In Gethsemane it was as
if the Father would not hear: He prayed yet
more earnestly, until &ldquo;He was heard.&rdquo; In the
way He opened up for us, He learned obedience
by the things He suffered, and so was made perfect;
His will was given up to God; His faith in God
was proved and strengthened; the prince of this
world, with all his temptation, was overcome.
This is the new and living way He consecrated for
us; it is in persevering prayer we walk with and
are made partakers of His very Spirit. Prayer is
one form of crucifixion, of our fellowship with
Christ&#8217;s Cross, of our giving up our flesh to the
death. O Christians! shall we not be ashamed
of our reluctance to sacrifice the flesh and our own
will and the world, as it is seen in our reluctance
to pray much? Shall we not learn the lesson
which nature and Christ alike teach? The difficulty
of importunate prayer is our highest privilege;
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">49</span><span class="ns">] </span>
the difficulties to be overcome in it bring us
our richest blessings.</p>

<p>In importunity there are various elements. Of
these the chief are perseverance, determination,
intensity. It begins with the refusal to at once
accept a denial. It grows to the determination
to persevere, to spare no time or trouble, till an
answer comes. It rises to the intensity in which
the whole being is given to God in supplication,
and the boldness comes to lay hold of God&#8217;s
strength. At one time it is quiet and restful; at
another passionate and bold. Now it takes time
and is patient; then again it claims at once what it
desires. In whatever different shape, it always means
and knows&mdash;God hears prayer: I must be heard.</p>

<p>Remember the wonderful instances we have
of it in the Old Testament saints. Think of
Abraham, as he pleads for Sodom. Time after
time he renews his prayer until the sixth time he
has to say, &ldquo;Let not my Lord be angry.&rdquo; He does
not cease until he has learnt to know God&#8217;s condescension
in each time consenting to his petition,
until he has learnt how far he can go, has entered
into God&#8217;s mind, and now rests in God&#8217;s will. And
for his sake Lot was saved. &ldquo;God remembered
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">50</span><span class="ns">] </span>
Abraham, and delivered Lot out of the midst of the
overthrow.&rdquo; And shall not we, who have a
redemption and promises for the heathen which
Abraham never knew, begin to plead more with
God on their behalf.</p>

<p>Think of Jacob, when he feared to meet Esau.
The angel of the Lord met him in the dark, and
wrestled with him. And when the angel saw that
he prevailed not, he said, &ldquo;Let me go.&rdquo; And
Jacob said, &ldquo;I will not let thee go.&rdquo; And he
blessed him there. And that boldness that said,
&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; and forced from the reluctant angel
the blessing, was so pleasing in God&#8217;s sight, that a
new name was there given to him: &ldquo;Israel, he
who striveth with God, for thou hast striven with
God and with men, and hast prevailed.&rdquo; And
through all the ages God&#8217;s children have understood,
what Christ&#8217;s two parables teach, that God holds
Himself back, and seeks to get away from us, until
what is of flesh and self and sloth in us is overcome,
and we so prevail with Him that He can and must
bless us. Oh! why is it that so many of God&#8217;s
children have no desire for this honour&mdash;being
princes of God, strivers with God, and prevailing?
What our Lord taught us, &ldquo;What things soever ye
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">51</span><span class="ns">] </span>
desire, <em>believe that ye have received</em>,&rdquo; is nothing but
His putting of Jacob&#8217;s words, &ldquo;I will not let Thee
go except thou bless me.&rdquo; This is the importunity
He teaches, and we must learn: to claim and take
the blessing.</p>

<p>Think of Moses when Israel had made the
golden calf. Moses returned to the Lord and
said, &ldquo;Oh, this people have sinned a great sin. Yet
now, if Thou wilt forgive their sin&mdash;; and if not, blot
me, I pray Thee, out of Thy book which Thou hast
written.&rdquo; That was importunity, that would
rather die than not have his people given him.
Then, when God had heard him, and said He
would send His angel with the people, Moses came
again, and would not be content until, in answer to
his prayer that God Himself should go with them
(xxxiii.&nbsp;12, 17,&nbsp;18), He had said, &ldquo;I will do this
thing also that thou hast spoken.&rdquo; After that,
when in answer to his prayer, &ldquo;Show me Thy
glory,&rdquo; God made His goodness pass before him, he
at once again began pleading, &ldquo;Let my Lord, I pray
Thee, go among us.&rdquo; And he was there with the
Lord forty days and forty nights (Ex. xxxiv.&nbsp;28).
Of these days he says, &ldquo;I fell down before the Lord,
as at the first, forty days and forty nights, I did
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">52</span><span class="ns">] </span>
neither eat bread, nor drink water, because
of all your sin which ye sinned.&rdquo; As an intercessor
Moses used importunity with God, and
prevailed. He proves that the man who truly
lives near to God, and with whom God speaks
face to face, becomes partaker of that same power of
intercession which there is in Him who is at God&#8217;s
right hand and ever lives to pray.</p>

<p>Think of Elijah in his prayer, first for fire, and
then for rain. In the former you have the importunity
that claims and receives an immediate answer.
In the latter, bowing himself down to the earth, his
face between his knees, his answer to the servant
who had gone to look toward the sea, and come
with the message, &ldquo;There is nothing,&rdquo; was &ldquo;Go
again seven times.&rdquo; Here was the importunity of
perseverance. He had told Ahab there would be
rain; he knew it was coming; and yet he prayed
till the seven times were fulfilled. And it is of
this Elijah and this prayer we are taught, &ldquo;Pray
for one another. Elijah was a man of like passions
with ourselves. The effectual fervent prayer of a
righteous man availeth much.&rdquo; Will there not be
some who feel constrained to cry out, &ldquo;Where is
the Lord God of Elijah?&rdquo;&mdash;this God who draws
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">53</span><span class="ns">] </span>
forth such effectual prayer, and hears it so wonderfully.
His name be praised: He is still the same.
Let His people but believe that He still waits to
be inquired of! Faith in a prayer-hearing God
will make a prayer-loving Christian.</p>

<p>We remember the marks of the true intercessor as
the parable taught us them. A sense of the need of
souls; a Christlike love in the heart; a consciousness
of personal impotence; faith in the power of prayer;
courage to persevere in spite of refusal; and the
assurance of an abundant reward;&mdash;these are the
dispositions that constitute a Christian an intercessor,
and call forth the power of prevailing prayer.
These are the dispositions that constitute the
beauty and the health of the Christian life, that fit
a man for being a blessing in the world, that make
him a true Christian worker, who does indeed get
from God the bread of heaven to dispense to the
hungry. These are the dispositions that call forth
the highest, the heroic virtues of the life of faith.
There is nothing to which the nobility of natural
character owes so much as the spirit of enterprise
and daring which in travel or war, in politics or
science, battles with difficulties and conquers. No
labour or expense is grudged for the sake of
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">54</span><span class="ns">] </span>
victory. And shall we who are Christians not
be able to face the difficulties that we meet in
prayer? It is as we &ldquo;labour&rdquo; and &ldquo;strive&rdquo; in
prayer that the renewed will asserts its royal right
to claim in the name of Christ what it will, and
wields its God-given power to influence the destinies
of men. Shall men of the world sacrifice
ease and pleasure in their pursuits, and shall we
be such cowards and sluggards as not to fight our
way through to the place where we can find liberty
for the captive and salvation for the perishing?
Let each servant of Christ learn to know his
calling. His King ever lives to pray. The Spirit
of the King ever lives in us to pray. It is from
heaven the blessings, which the world needs,
must be called down in persevering, importunate,
believing prayer. It is from heaven, in answer
to prayer, the Holy Spirit will take complete
possession of us to do His work through us. Let
us acknowledge how vain our much work has been
owing to our little prayer. Let us change our
method, and let henceforth more prayer, much prayer,
unceasing prayer, be the proof that we look for all
to God, and that we believe that He heareth us.</p>

asks a favour for others depends entirely
on his character, and the relationship he bears
to him with whom he is interceding. It is
what he is that gives weight to what he asks.
It is no otherwise with God. Our power in
prayer depends upon our life. Where our life
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">56</span><span class="ns">] </span>
is right we shall know how to pray so as to
please God, and prayer will secure the answer.
The texts quoted above all point in this direction.
&ldquo;<em>If ye abide in Me</em>,&rdquo; our Lord says, ye
shall ask, and it shall be done unto you. It
is the prayer of <em>a righteous man</em>, according to
James, that availeth much. We receive whatsoever
we ask, John says, <em>because</em> we obey and
please God. All lack of power to pray aright
and perseveringly, all lack of power in prayer
with God, points to some lack in the Christian
life. It is as we learn to live the life that
pleases God, that God will give what we ask.
Let us learn from our Lord Jesus, in the parable
of the vine, what the healthy, vigorous life is
that may ask and receive what it will. Hear
His voice, &ldquo;If ye abide in Me, and My words
abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it
shall be done unto you.&rdquo; And again at the close
of the parable: &ldquo;Ye did not choose Me, but I
chose you, and appointed you, that you should go
and bear fruit, and that your fruit should abide:
that <em>whatsoever ye shall ask</em> the Father in My
name, <em>He may give it you</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And what is now, according to the parable,
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">57</span><span class="ns">] </span>
the life that one must lead to bear fruit, and
then ask and receive what we will? What is it
we are to be or do, that will enable us to pray
as we should, and to receive what we ask? The
answer is in one word: it is the branch-life that
gives power for prayer. We are branches of
Christ, the Living Vine. We must simply live
like branches, and abide in Christ, then we shall
ask what we will, and it shall be done unto us.</p>

<p>We all know what a branch is, and what its
essential characteristic. It is simply a growth
of the vine, produced by it and appointed to bear
fruit. It has only one reason of existence; it
is there at the bidding of the vine, that through
it the vine may bear and ripen its precious fruit.
Just as the vine only and solely and wholly
lives to produce the sap that makes the grape,
so the branch has no other aim and object but
this alone, to receive that sap and bear the grape.
Its only work is to serve the vine, that through
it the vine may do its work.</p>

<p>And the believer, the branch of Christ the
Heavenly Vine, is it to be understood that he is as
literally, as exclusively, to live only that Christ
may bear fruit through him? Is it meant that
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">58</span><span class="ns">] </span>
a true Christian as a branch is to be just as
absorbed in and devoted to the work of bearing
fruit to the glory of God as Christ the Vine
was on earth, and is now in heaven? This, and
nothing less, is indeed what is meant. It is to
such that the unlimited prayer promises of the
parable are given. It is the branch-life, existing
solely for the Vine, that will have the power to
pray aright. With our life abiding in Him, and
His words abiding, kept and obeyed, in our heart
and life, transmuted into our very being, there
will be the grace to pray aright, and the faith
to receive the whatsoever we will.</p>

<p>Do let us connect the two things, and take
them both in their simple, literal truth, and their
infinite, divine grandeur. The promises of our
Lord&#8217;s farewell discourse, with their wonderful six-fold
repetition of the unlimited, <em>anything, whatsoever</em>
(John xiv. 13,&nbsp;14; xv. 7,&nbsp;16; xvi. 23,&nbsp;24),
appear to us altogether too large to be taken
literally, and they are qualified down to meet
our human ideas of what appears seemly. It is
because we separate them from that life of
absolute and unlimited devotion to Christ&#8217;s service
to which they were given. God&#8217;s covenant
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">59</span><span class="ns">] </span>
is ever: Give all and take all. He that is willing
to be wholly branch, and nothing but branch,
who is ready to place himself absolutely at the
disposal of Jesus the Vine of God, to bear His
fruit through him, and to live every moment
only for Him, will receive a Divine liberty to
claim Christ&#8217;s <em>whatsoever</em> in all its fulness, and
a Divine wisdom and humility to use it aright.
He will live and pray, and claim the Father&#8217;s
promises, even as Christ did, only for God&#8217;s glory
in the salvation of men. He will use his boldness
in prayer only with a view to power in
intercession, and getting men blessed. The unlimited
devotion of the branch-life to fruitbearing,
and the unlimited access to the treasures of the
Vine life, are inseparable. It is the life abiding
wholly in Christ that can pray the effectual prayer
in the name of Christ.</p>

<p>Just think for a moment of the men of prayer
in Scripture, and see in them what the life was
that could pray in such power. We spoke of
Abraham as intercessor. What gave Him such
boldness? He knew that God had chosen and
called him away from his home and people to walk
before Him, that all nations might be blessed in
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">60</span><span class="ns">] </span>
him. He knew that he had obeyed, and forsaken
all for God. Implicit obedience, to the very sacrifice
of his son, was the law of his life. He did what
God asked: he dared trust God to do what he
asked. We spoke of Moses as intercessor. He
too had forsaken all for God, &ldquo;counting the
reproach of Christ greater riches than all the
treasures of Egypt.&rdquo; He lived at God&#8217;s disposal:
&ldquo;as a servant he was faithful in all His house.&rdquo;
How often it is written of him, &ldquo;According to all
that the Lord commanded Moses, so did he.&rdquo; No
wonder that he was very bold: his heart was right
with God: he knew God would hear him. No less
true is this of Elijah, the man who stood up to
plead for the Lord God of Israel. The man who
is ready to risk all for God can count upon God to
do all for him.</p>

<p>It is as men live that they pray. It is the
life that prays. It is the life that, with whole-hearted
devotion, gives up all for God and to God,
that can claim all from God. Our God longs
exceedingly to prove Himself the Faithful God and
Mighty Helper of His people. He only waits for
hearts wholly turned from the world to Himself,
and open to receive His gifts. The man who loses
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">61</span><span class="ns">] </span>
all will find all; he dare ask and take it. The
branch that only and truly lives abiding in Christ,
the Heavenly Vine, entirely given up, like Christ, to
bear fruit in the salvation of men, and has His
words taken up into and abiding in its life, may
and dare ask what it will&mdash;it shall be done. And
where we have not yet attained to that full
devotion to which our Lord had trained His
disciples, and cannot equal them in their power
of prayer, we may, nevertheless, take courage in
remembering that, even in the lower stages of
the Christian life, every new onward step in the
striving after the perfect branch-life, and every
surrender to live for others in intercession, will be
met from above by a corresponding liberty to
draw nigh with greater boldness, and expect larger
answers. The more we pray, and the more conscious
we become of our unfitness to pray in power,
the more we shall be urged and helped to press
on towards the secret of power in prayer&mdash;a life
abiding in Christ entirely at His disposal.</p>

<p>And if any are asking, with somewhat of a
despair of attainment, what the reason may be of
the failure in this blessed branch-life, so simple
and yet so mighty, and how they can come to it, let
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">62</span><span class="ns">] </span>
me point them to one of the most precious lessons
of the parable of the Vine. It is one that is all
too little noticed. Jesus spake, &ldquo;I am the true
Vine, <em>and my Father is the Husbandman</em>.&rdquo; We
have not only Himself, the glorified Son of God,
in His divine fulness, out of whose fulness of life
and grace we can draw,&mdash;this is very wonderful,&mdash;but
there is something more blessed still. We
have the Father, as the Husbandman, watching
over our abiding in the Vine, over our growth and
fruitbearing. It is not left to our faith or our
faithfulness to maintain our union with Christ:
the God, who is the Father of Christ, and who
united us with Him,&mdash;God Himself will see to it
that the branch is what it should be, will enable
us to bring forth just the fruit we were appointed
to bear. Hear what Christ said of this, &ldquo;Every
branch that beareth fruit, He cleanseth it, that it
may bear more fruit.&rdquo; More fruit is what the
Father seeks; more fruit is what the Father will
Himself provide. It is for this that He, as the
Vinedresser, cleanses the branches.</p>

<p>Just think a moment what this means. It is
said that of all fruitbearing plants on earth there
is none that produces fruit so full of spirit, from
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">63</span><span class="ns">] </span>
which spirit can be so abundantly distilled, as the
vine. And of all fruitbearing plants there is none
that is so ready to run into wild wood, and for
which pruning and cleansing are so indispensable.
The one great work that a vinedresser has to do
for the branch every year is to prune it. Other
plants can for a time dispense with it, and yet
bear fruit: the vine <em>must</em> have it. And so the
one thing the branch that desires to abide in
Christ and bring forth much fruit, and to be able
to ask whatsoever it will, must do, is to trust in and
yield itself to this Divine cleansing. What is it that
the vinedresser cuts away with his pruning-knife?
Nothing but the wood that the branch has produced&mdash;true,
honest wood, with the true vine nature in it.
This must be cut away. And why? Because
it draws away the strength and life of the vine,
and hinders the flow of the juice to the grape.
The more it is cut down, the less wood there is in
the branch, the more all the sap can go to the
grape. The wood of the branch must decrease,
that the fruit for the vine may increase; in
obedience to the law of all nature, that death is
the way to life, that gain comes through sacrifice,
the rich and luxuriant growth of wood must be cut
<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">64</span><span class="ns">] </span>
off and cast away, that the life more abundant may
be seen in the cluster.</p>

<p>Even so, child of God, branch of the Heavenly
Vine, there is in thee that which appears perfectly
innocent and legitimate, and which yet so draws
out thy interest and thy strength, that it must be
pruned and cleansed away. We saw what power
in prayer men like Abraham and Moses and Elijah
had, and we know what fruit they bore. But we
also know what it cost them; how God had to
separate them from their surroundings, and ever
again to draw them from any trust in themselves,
to seek their life in Him alone. It is only as our
own will, and strength and effort and pleasure, even
where these appear perfectly natural and sinless, are
cut down, so that the whole energies of our being
are free and open to receive the sap of the
Heavenly Vine, the Holy Spirit, that we shall bear
much fruit. It is in the surrender of what nature
holds fast, it is in the full and willing submission
to God&#8217;s holy pruning-knife, that we shall come to
what Christ chose and appointed us for&mdash;to bear
fruit, that whatsoever we ask the Father in Christ&#8217;s
name, He may give to us.</p>

<p>What the pruning-knife is, Christ tells us in the
<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">65</span><span class="ns">] </span>
next verse. &ldquo;Ye are <em>clean through the word</em> which
I have spoken to you.&rdquo; As He says later,
&ldquo;Sanctify them through Thy truth; Thy word is
truth.&rdquo; &ldquo;The word of God is sharper than any
two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of
soul and spirit.&rdquo; What heart-searching words
Christ had spoken to His disciples on love and
humility, on being the least, and, like Himself, the
servant of all, on denying self, and taking the
cross, and losing the life. Through His word
the Father had cleansed them, cut away all
confidence in themselves or the world, and prepared
them for the inflowing and filling of the Spirit of
the Heavenly Vine. It is not we who can cleanse
ourselves: God is the Vinedresser: we may confidently
intrust ourselves to His care.</p>

<p>Beloved brethren,&mdash;ministers, missionaries,
teachers, workers, believers old and young,&mdash;are
you mourning your lack of prayer, and, as a consequence,
your lack of power in prayer? Oh! come and
listen to your beloved Lord as He tells you, &ldquo;only be
a branch, united to, identified with, the Heavenly
Vine, and your prayers will be effectual and much
availing.&rdquo; Are you mourning that just this is your
trouble&mdash;you do not, cannot, live this branch-life,
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">66</span><span class="ns">] </span>
abiding in Him? Oh! come and listen again.
&ldquo;<em>More fruit</em>&rdquo; is not only your desire, but the Father&#8217;s
too. He is the Husbandman who cleanseth the
fruitful branch, that it may bear more fruit. Cast
yourself upon God, to do in you what is impossible
to man. Count upon a Divine cleansing, to cut
down and take away all that self-confidence and
self-effort, that has been the cause of your failure.
The God who gave you His beloved Son to be
your Vine, who made you His branch, will He not
do His work of cleansing to make you fruitful in
every good work, in the work of prayer and intercession
too?</p>

<p>Here is the life that can pray. A branch
entirely given up to the Vine and its aims, with all
responsibility for its cleansing cast on the Vinedresser;
a branch abiding in Christ, trusting and
yielding to God for His cleansing, can bear much
fruit. In the power of such a life we shall love
prayer, we shall know how to pray, we shall
pray, and receive whatsoever we ask.</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="start">Any</span> deep quickening of the spiritual life of the
Church will always be accompanied by a
deeper sense of sin. This will not begin with
theology; that can only give expression to what
God works in the life of His people. Nor does it
mean that that deeper sense of sin will only be
seen in stronger expressions of self-reproach or
penitence: that is sometimes found to consist with
a harbouring of sin, and unbelief as to deliverance.
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">68</span><span class="ns">] </span>
But the true sense of the hatefulness of sin, the hatred
of it, will be proved by the intensity of desire for
deliverance, and the struggle to know to the very
utmost what God can do in saving from it&mdash;a holy
jealousy, in nothing to sin against God.</p>

<p>If we are to deal effectually with the lack of
prayer we must look at it from this point of view
and ask, Restraining prayer, is it sin? And if it
be, how is it to be dealt with, to be discovered, and
confessed, and cast out by man, and cleansed away
by God? Jesus is a Saviour from sin. It is only
as we know sin truly that we can truly know the
power that saves from sin. The life that can pray
effectually is the life of the cleansed branch&mdash;the
life that knows deliverance from the power of self.
To see that our prayer-sins are indeed sins, is the
first step to a true and Divine deliverance from them.</p>

<p>In the story of Achan we have one of the
strongest proofs in Scripture that it is sin that robs
God&#8217;s people of His blessing, and that God will not
tolerate it; and at the same time the clearest
indication of the principles under which God deals
with it, and removes it. Let us see in the light of
the story if we can learn how to look at the sin of
prayerlessness, and at the sinfulness that lies at
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">69</span><span class="ns">] </span>
the root of it. The words I have quoted above,
&ldquo;Neither will I be with you any more, except ye
put away the accursed thing from among you,&rdquo;
take us into the very heart of the story, and
suggest a series of the most precious lessons
around the truth they express, that the presence of
sin makes the presence of God impossible.</p>

<p>1. <em>The presence of God is the great privilege of
God&#8217;s people, and their only power against the enemy.</em>&mdash;God
had promised to Moses, <em>I will bring you in</em>
unto the land. Moses proved that he understood
this when God, after the sin of the golden calf,
spoke of withdrawing His presence and sending an
angel. He refused to accept anything less than
God&#8217;s presence. &ldquo;For whereby shall it be known
that I and Thy people have found grace in Thy
sight? Is it not that <em>Thou goest with us</em>?&rdquo; It was
this gave Caleb and Joshua their confidence: The
Lord is with us. It was this gave Israel their victory
over Jericho: the presence of God. This is
throughout Scripture the great central promise: I
am with thee. This marks off the whole-hearted
believer from the worldling and worldly Christians
around him: he lives consciously hidden in the
secret of God&#8217;s presence.</p>

<p><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">70</span><span class="ns">] </span>
2. <em>Defeat and failure are always owing to the loss
of God&#8217;s presence.</em>&mdash;It was thus at Ai. God had
brought His people into Canaan with the promise
to give them the land. When the defeat at Ai
took place Joshua felt at once that the cause must
be in the withdrawal of God&#8217;s power. He had
not fought for them. His presence had been withheld.</p>

<p>In the Christian life and the work of the Church,
defeat is ever a sign of the loss of God&#8217;s presence.
If we apply this to our failure in the prayer-life,
and as a result of that to our failure in work for God,
we are led to see that all is simply owing to our
not standing in clear and full fellowship with God.
His nearness, His immediate presence, has not been
the chief thing sought after and trusted in. He
could not work in us as He would. Loss of blessing
and power is ever caused by the loss of God&#8217;s
presence.</p>

<p>3. <em>The loss of God&#8217;s presence is always owing to
some hidden sin.</em>&mdash;Just as pain is ordered in nature
to warn of some hidden evil in the system, defeat
is God&#8217;s voice telling us there is something wrong.
He has given Himself so wholly to His people, He
delights so in being with them, and would so fain
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">71</span><span class="ns">] </span>
reveal in them His love and power, that He never
withdraws Himself unless they compel Him by sin.</p>

<p>Throughout the Church there is a complaint of
defeat. The Church has so little power over the
masses, or the educated classes. Powerful conversions
are comparatively rare. The fewness of holy,
consecrated, spiritual Christians, devoted to the
service of God and their fellowmen, is felt everywhere.
The power of the Church for the preaching
of the gospel to the heathen is paralysed by the
scarcity of money and men; and all owing to the
lack of the effectual prayer which brings the Holy
Spirit in power, first on ministers and believers,
then on missionaries and the heathen. Can we
deny it that the lack of prayer is the sin on
account of which God&#8217;s presence and power are not
more manifestly seen among us?</p>

<p>4. <em>God Himself will discover the hidden sin.</em>&mdash;We
may think we know what the sin is: it is only God
who can discover its real deep meaning. When
He spoke to Joshua, before naming the sin of
Achan, God first said, &ldquo;They have transgressed My
covenant which I commanded them.&rdquo; God had
commanded (vi.&nbsp;19) that all the booty of Jericho,
gold and silver and all that was in it, was to be a
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">72</span><span class="ns">] </span>
devoted thing, consecrated unto the Lord, and to
come into His treasury. And Israel had broken
this consecration vow: it had not given God His
due; it had robbed God.</p>

<p>It is this we need: God must discover to us how
the lack of prayer is the indication of unfaithfulness
to our consecration vow, that God should have all
our heart and life. We must see that this restraining
prayer, with the excuses we make for it, is
greater sin than we have thought; for what does it
mean? That we have little taste or relish for
fellowship with God; that our faith rests more on
our own work and efforts than on the power of
God; that we have little sense of the heavenly
blessing God waits to shower down; that we are
not ready to sacrifice the ease and confidence of the
flesh for persevering waiting on God; that the
spirituality of our life, and our abiding in Christ, is
altogether too feeble to make us prevail in prayer.
When the pressure of work for Christ is allowed
to be the excuse for our not finding time to seek
and secure His own presence and power in it, as
our chief need, it surely proves that there is no
right sense of our absolute dependence upon God;
no deep apprehension of the Divine and supernatural
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">73</span><span class="ns">] </span>
work of God in which we are only His
instruments, no true entrance into the heavenly,
altogether other-worldly, character of our mission
and aims, no full surrender to and delight in Christ
Jesus Himself.</p>

<p>If we were to yield to God&#8217;s Spirit to show us
that all this is in very deed the meaning of remissness
in prayer, and of our allowing other things
to crowd it out, all our excuses would fall away,
and we should fall down and cry, &ldquo;We have sinned!
we have sinned!&rdquo; Samuel once said, &ldquo;As for me,
God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in
ceasing to pray for you.&rdquo; Ceasing from prayer is
sin against God. May God discover this to us.
(<a name="nta.A" id="nta.A" href="#nt.A">Note A.</a>)</p>

<p>5. <em>When God discovers sin, it must be confessed
and cast out.</em>&mdash;When the defeat at Ai came, Joshua
and Israel were ignorant of the cause. God dealt
with Israel as a nation, as one body, and the sin of
one member was visited on all. Israel as a whole
was ignorant of the sin, and yet suffered for
it. The Church may be ignorant of the greatness of
this sin of restraining prayer, individual ministers
or believers may never have looked upon it as
actual transgression, none the less does it bring its
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">74</span><span class="ns">] </span>
punishment. But when the sin is no more hidden,
when the Holy Spirit begins to convince of it, then
comes the time of heart-searching. In our story
the combination of individual and united responsibility
is very solemn. The individual: as we find
it in the expression, &ldquo;man for man&rdquo;; each man felt
himself under the eye of God, to be dealt with. And
when Achan had been taken, he had to make confession.
The united: as we see it in all Israel first
suffering and dealt with by God, then taking Achan,
and his family, and the accursed thing, and destroying
them out of their midst.</p>

<p>If we have reason to think this is the sin that
is in the camp, let us begin with personal and
united confession. And then let us come before
God to put away and destroy the sin. Here stands
at the very threshold of Israel&#8217;s history in Canaan
the heap of stones in the valley of Achor, to tell us
that God cannot bear sin, that God will not dwell
with sin, and that if <em>we really want God&#8217;s presence in
power, sin must be put away</em>. Let us look the solemn
fact in the face. There may be other sins, but here
is certainly one that causes the loss of God&#8217;s presence&mdash;we
do not pray as Christ and Scripture teach
us. Let us bring it out before God, and give up this
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">75</span><span class="ns">] </span>
sin to the death. Let us yield ourselves to God to
obey His voice. Let no fear of past failure, let no
threatening array of temptations, or duties, or
excuses, keep us back. It is a simple question of
obedience. Are we going to give up ourselves to
God and His Spirit to live a life in prayer, well-pleasing
to Him? Surely, if it is God who has been
withholding His presence, who has been discovering
the sin, who is calling for its destruction, and a
return to obedience, surely we can count upon His
grace to accept and strengthen for the life He asks
of us. It is not a question of what you can do;
it is the question of whether you now, with your
whole heart, turn to give God His due, and give
yourself to let His will and grace have their way
with you.</p>

<p>6. <em>With sin cast out God&#8217;s presence is restored.</em>&mdash;From
this day onwards there is not a word in
Joshua of defeat in battle. The story shows them
going on from victory to victory. God&#8217;s presence
secured gives power to overcome every enemy.</p>

<p>This truth is so simple that the very ease with
which we acquiesce in it robs it of its power. Let
us pause and think what it implies. God&#8217;s presence
restored means victory secured. Then, we are
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">76</span><span class="ns">] </span>
responsible for defeat. Then, there must be sin
somewhere causing it. Then, we ought at once
to find out and put away the sin. We may confidently
expect God&#8217;s presence the moment the sin
is put away. Surely each one is under the solemn
obligation to search his life and see what part he
may have in this evil.</p>

<p>God never speaks to His people of sin except
with a view to saving them from it. <em>The same light
that shows the sin will show the way out of it.</em> The
same power that breaks down and condemns will, if
humbly yielded to and waited on in confession and
faith, give the power to rise up and conquer. It
is <span class="smc">God</span> who is speaking to His Church and to us
about this sin: &ldquo;<span class="smc">He wondered</span> that there was no
intercessor.&rdquo; &ldquo;<span class="smc">I wondered</span> that there was none
to uphold.&rdquo; &ldquo;<span class="smc">I sought</span> for a man that should
stand in the gap before Me, and found none.&rdquo; The
God who speaks thus is He who will work the
change for His children who seek His face. He
will make the valley of Achor, of trouble and shame,
of sin confessed and cast out, a door of hope. Let
us not fear, let us not cling to the excuses and
explanations which circumstances suggest, but
simply confess, &ldquo;We have sinned; we are sinning;
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">77</span><span class="ns">] </span>
we dare not sin longer.&rdquo; In this matter of prayer
we are sure God does not demand of us impossibilities.
He does not weary us with an impracticable
ideal. He asks us to pray no more than He gives
grace to enable us to. He will give the grace to
do what He asks, and so to pray that our intercessions
shall, day by day, be a pleasure to Him
and to us, a source of strength to our conscience and
our work, and a channel of blessing to those for
whom we labour.</p>

<p>God dealt personally with Joshua, with Israel, with
Achan. Let each of us allow Him to deal personally
with us concerning this sin, of restraining prayer, and
its consequences in our life and work; concerning the
deliverance from sin, its certainty and blessedness.
Just bow in stillness and wait before God, until, as
God, He overshadow you with His presence, lead
you out of that region of argument as to human
possibilities, where conviction of sin can never be
deep, and full deliverance can never come. Take
quiet time, and be still before God, that He may
take this matter in hand. &ldquo;Sit still, for He will
not be in rest until He have finished this thing
this day.&rdquo; Leave yourself in God&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="start">During</span> one of our conventions a gentleman
called upon me to ask advice and help. He
was evidently an earnest and well-instructed
Christian man. He had for some years been in most
difficult surroundings, trying to witness for Christ.
The result was a sense of failure and unhappiness.
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">79</span><span class="ns">] </span>
His complaint was that he had no relish for the
Word, and that though he prayed, it was as if his
heart was not in it. If he spoke to others, or
gave a tract, it was under a sense of duty: the love
and the joy were not present. He longed to be
filled with God&#8217;s Spirit, but the more he sought it,
the farther off it appeared to be. What was he
to think of his state, and was there any way out
of it?</p>

<p>My answer was, that the whole matter appeared
to me very simple; he was living under the law
and not under grace. As long as he did so, there
could be no change. He listened attentively,
but could not exactly see what I meant.</p>

<p>I reminded him of the difference, the utter contrariety,
between law and grace. Law demands;
grace bestows. Law commands, but gives no strength
to obey; grace promises, and performs, does all we
need to do. Law burdens, and casts down and
condemns; grace comforts, and makes strong and
glad. Law appeals to self, to do its utmost; grace
points to Christ to do all. Law calls to effort
and strain, and urges us towards a goal we never
can reach; grace works in us all God&#8217;s blessed
will. I pointed out to him how his first step
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">80</span><span class="ns">] </span>
should be, instead of striving against all this
failure, fully to accept of it, and the lesson of his
own impotence, as God had been seeking to teach it
him, and, with this confession, to sink down before
God in utter helplessness. There would be the
place where he would learn that, unless grace gave
him deliverance and strength, he never could do
better than he had done, and that grace would
indeed work all for him. He must come out from
under law and self and effort, and take his place
under grace, allowing God to do all.</p>

<p>In later conversations he told me the diagnosis
of the disease had been correct. He admitted
grace must do all. And yet, so deep was the
thought that we must do something, that we
must at least bring our faithfulness to secure the
work of grace, he feared that his life would not be
very different; he would not be equal to the strain
of new difficulties into which he was now going.
There was, amid all the intense earnestness, an
undertone of despair; he could not live as he
knew he ought to. I have already said, in the
opening chapter, that in some of our meetings I
had noticed this tone of hopelessness. And no
minister who has come into close contact with souls
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">81</span><span class="ns">] </span>
seeking to live wholly for God, to &ldquo;walk worthy
of the Lord unto all well pleasing,&rdquo; but knows
that this renders true progress impossible. To
speak specially of the lack of prayer, and the desire
of living a fuller prayer-life, how many are the
difficulties to be met! We have so often resolved
to pray more and better, and have failed. We
have not the strength of will some have, with one
resolve to turn round and change our habits. The
press of duty is as great as ever it was; it is
so difficult to find time for more prayer; real
enjoyment in prayer, which would enable us to
persevere, is what we do not feel; we do not
possess the power to supplicate and to plead, as we
should; our prayers, instead of being a joy and a
strength, are a source of continual self-condemnation
and doubt. We have at times mourned and
confessed and resolved; but, to tell the honest
truth, we do not expect, for we do not see the way
to, any great change.</p>

<p>It is evident that as long as this spirit prevails,
there can be very little prospect of improvement.
Discouragement must bring defeat. One of the
first objects of a physician is ever to waken hope;
without this he knows his medicines will often
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">82</span><span class="ns">] </span>
profit little. No teaching from God&#8217;s Word as to
the duty, the urgent need, the blessed privilege of
more prayer, of effectual prayer, will avail, while the
secret whisper is heard: There is no hope. Our
first care must be to find out the hidden cause
of the failure and despair, and then to show how
divinely sure deliverance is. We must, unless we
are to rest content with our state, listen to and
join in the question, &ldquo;Is there no balm in Gilead;
is there no physician there? why then is not
the health of the daughter of my people restored?&rdquo;
We must listen, and receive into our
heart, the Divine promise with the response it met
with: &ldquo;Return, ye backsliding children, and I will
heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto
Thee, for Thou art the Lord our God.&rdquo; We must
come with the personal prayer, and the faith that
there will be a personal answer. Shall we not
even now begin to claim it in regard to the lack of
prayer, and believe that God will help us: &ldquo;Heal
me, O Lord, and I shall be healed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is always of consequence to distinguish between
the symptoms of a disease and the disease itself.
Feebleness and failure in prayer is a sign of feebleness
in the spiritual life. If a patient were to ask
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">83</span><span class="ns">] </span>
a physician to give him something to stimulate his
feeble pulse, he would be told that this would do
him little good. The pulse is the index of the
state of the heart and the whole system: the
physician strives to have health restored. What
everyone who would fain pray more faithfully
and effectually must learn is this, that his whole
spiritual life is in a sickly state, and needs restoration.
It is as he comes to look, not only at his
shortcomings in prayer, but at the lack in the life
of faith, of which this is the symptom, that he will
become fully alive to the serious nature of the
disease. He will then see the need of a radical
change in his whole life and walk, if his prayer-life,
which is simply the pulse of the spiritual
system, is to indicate health and vigour. God has
so created us that the exercise of every healthy
function causes joy. Prayer is meant to be as
simple and natural as breathing or working to a
healthy man. The reluctance we feel, and the
failure we confess, are God&#8217;s own voice calling us
to acknowledge our disease, and to come to Him
for the healing He has promised.</p>

<p>And what is now the disease of which the lack
of prayer is the symptom? We cannot find a better
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">84</span><span class="ns">] </span>
answer than is pointed out in the words, &ldquo;Ye are
not under the law, but under grace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here we have suggested the possibility of two
types of Christian life. There may be a life partly
under the law and partly under grace; or, a life
entirely under grace, in the full liberty from self-effort,
and the full experience of the Divine strength
which it can give. A true believer may still be
living partly under the law, in the power of self-effort,
striving to do what he cannot accomplish.
The continued failure in his Christian life to which
he confesses is owing to this one thing: he trusts
in himself, and tries to do his best. He does,
indeed, pray and look to God for help, but still it
is he in his strength, helped by God, who is to do
the work. In the Epistles to the Romans, and
Corinthians, and Galatians, we know how Paul tells
them that they have not received the spirit of
bondage again, that they are free from the law,
that they are no more servants but sons; that they
must beware of nothing so much as to be entangled
again with the yoke of bondage. Everywhere
it is the contrast between the law and grace,
between the flesh, which is under the law, and the
Spirit, who is the gift of grace, and through whom
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">85</span><span class="ns">] </span>
grace does all its work. In our days, just as in
those first ages, the great danger is living under the
law, and serving God in the strength of the flesh.
With the great majority of Christians it appears
to be the state in which they remain all their
lives. Hence the lack to such a large extent of
true holy living and power in prayer. They do
not know that all failure can have but one cause:
<em>Men seek to do themselves what grace alone can do in
them</em>, what grace most certainly will do.</p>

<p>Many will not be prepared to admit that this is
their disease, that they are not living &ldquo;under grace.&rdquo;
Impossible, they say. &ldquo;From the depth of my
heart,&rdquo; a Christian cries, &ldquo;I believe and know that
there is no good in me, and that I owe everything
to grace alone.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have spent my life,&rdquo; a minister
says, &ldquo;and found my glory in preaching and exalting
the doctrines of free grace.&rdquo; &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; a missionary
answers, &ldquo;how could I ever have thought of seeing
the heathen saved, if my only confidence had not
been in the message I brought, and the power I
trusted, of God&#8217;s abounding grace.&rdquo; Surely you
cannot say that our failures in prayer, and we sadly
confess to them, are owing to our not living &ldquo;under
grace&rdquo;? This cannot be our disease.</p>

<p><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">86</span><span class="ns">] </span>
We know how often a man may be suffering
from a disease without knowing it. What he
counts a slight ailment turns out to be a dangerous
complaint. Do not let us be too sure that
we are not, to a large extent, still living &ldquo;under
the law,&rdquo; while considering ourselves to be living
wholly &ldquo;under grace.&rdquo; Very frequently the reason
of this mistake is the limited meaning attached
to the word &ldquo;grace.&rdquo; Just as we limit God Himself,
by our little or unbelieving thoughts of Him, so
we limit His grace at the very moment that we are
delighting in terms like the &ldquo;riches of grace,&rdquo; &ldquo;grace
exceeding abundant.&rdquo; Has not the very term, &ldquo;grace
abounding,&rdquo; from Bunyan&#8217;s book downward, been
confined to the one great blessed truth of free
justification with ever renewed pardon and eternal
glory for the vilest of sinners, while the other
equally blessed truth of &ldquo;grace abounding&rdquo; in sanctification
is not fully known. Paul writes: &ldquo;Much
more shall they which receive the abundance of grace
reign in life through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; That reigning
in life, as conqueror over sin, is even here on
earth. &ldquo;Where sin abounded&rdquo; in the heart and
life, &ldquo;grace did abound more exceedingly, that
grace might reign through righteousness&rdquo; in the
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">87</span><span class="ns">] </span>
whole life and being of the believer. It is of this
reign of grace in the soul that Paul asks, &ldquo;Shall
we sin because we are under grace?&rdquo; and answers,
&ldquo;God forbid.&rdquo; Grace is not only pardon of, but
power over, sin; grace takes the place sin had in
the life, and undertakes, as sin had reigned within in
the power of death, to reign in the power of Christ&#8217;s
life. It is of this grace that Christ spoke, &ldquo;My
grace is sufficient for thee,&rdquo; and Paul answered,
&ldquo;I will glory in my weakness; for, when I am
weak, then am I strong.&rdquo; It is of this grace,
which, when we are willing to confess ourselves
utterly impotent and helpless, comes in to work
all in us, that Paul elsewhere teaches, &ldquo;God is
able to make <em>all grace</em> abound unto you, that ye,
<em>always</em> having <em>all sufficiency</em> in <em>all things</em>, may
abound unto <em>all good works</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It has often happened that a seeker after God
and salvation has read his Bible long, and yet
never seen the truth of a free and full and immediate
justification by faith. When once his eyes were
opened, and he accepted it, he was amazed to find
it everywhere. Even so many believers, who hold
the doctrines of free grace as applied to pardon,
have never seen its wondrous meaning as it
<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">88</span><span class="ns">] </span>
undertakes to work our whole life in us, and <em>actually
give us strength every moment</em> for whatever the
Father would have us be and do. When God&#8217;s
light shines into our heart with this blessed truth,
we know what Paul means, &ldquo;Not I, but the grace
of God.&rdquo; There again you have the twofold Christian
life. The one, in which that &ldquo;Not I&rdquo;&mdash;I am
nothing, I can do nothing&mdash;has not yet become a
reality. The other, when the wondrous exchange
has been made, and grace has taken the place of
our effort, and we say and know, &ldquo;I live, yet no
longer I, but Christ liveth in me.&rdquo; It may then
become a lifelong experience: &ldquo;The grace of our
Lord was exceeding abundant, with faith and love
which is in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beloved child of God! what think you, is it not
possible that this has been the want in your life,
the cause of your failure in prayer? You knew
not how grace would enable you to pray, if once
the whole life were under its power. You sought
by earnest effort to conquer your reluctance or
deadness in prayer, but failed. You strove by every
motive of shame or love you could think of to stir
yourself to it, but it would not help. Is it not
worth while asking the Lord whether the message
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">89</span><span class="ns">] </span>
I bring you as His servant may not be more true
for you than you think? Your lack of prayer is
owing to a diseased state of life, and the disease is
nothing but this&mdash;you have not accepted, for daily
life and every duty, the full salvation which the
word brings: &ldquo;Ye are not under the law, but under
grace.&rdquo; As universal and deep-reaching as the
demand of the law and the reign of sin, yea, more
exceeding abundant, is the provision of grace and the
power by which it makes us reign in life. (<a name="nta.B" id="nta.B" href="#nt.B">Note B.</a>)</p>

<p>In the chapter that follows that in which Paul
wrote, &ldquo;Ye are not under the law, but under grace,&rdquo;
he gives us a picture of a believer&#8217;s life under law,
with the bitter experience in which it ends: &ldquo;O
wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from
the body of this death?&rdquo; His answer to the question,
&ldquo;I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord,&rdquo;
shows that there is deliverance from a life held
captive under evil habits that have been struggled
against in vain. That deliverance is by the Holy
Spirit giving the full experience of what the life of
Christ can work in us: &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of
life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the
law of sin and death.&rdquo; The law of God could only
deliver us into the power of the law of sin and
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">90</span><span class="ns">] </span>
death. The grace of God can bring us into, and
keep us in, the liberty of the Spirit. We can be
made free from the sad life under the power that
led us captive, so that we did not what we would.
The Spirit of life in Christ can free us from our
continual failure in prayer, and enable us in this,
too, to walk worthy of the Lord unto all well-pleasing.</p>

<p>Oh! be not hopeless, be not despondent; there
is a balm in Gilead; there is a Physician there;
there is healing for our sickness. What is impossible
with man is possible with God. What you
see no possibility of doing, grace will do. Confess
the disease; trust the Physician; claim the healing;
pray the prayer of faith, &ldquo;Heal me, and I shall be
healed.&rdquo; You too can become a man of prayer, and
pray the effectual prayer that availeth much.<sup><a name="fna.1" id="fna.1"

Impotence to walk is, in the Christian, as in
the natural life, a terrible proof of some evil in the
system that needs a physician. The lack of power
to walk joyfully in the new and living way that
leads to the Father and the throne of grace is
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">92</span><span class="ns">] </span>
specially grievous. Christ is the great Physician,
who comes to every Bethesda where impotent folk
are gathered, and speaks out his loving, searching
question, Wilt thou be made whole? For all who are
still clinging to their hope in the pool, or are looking

healing in a way of power they have never understood.
And to all who are willing to confess, not only their
own impotence, but their failure to find any man to
help them, His question brings the sure and certain
hope of a near deliverance. We have seen that our
weakness in prayer is part of a life smitten with
spiritual impotence. Let us listen to our Lord as
He offers to restore our spiritual strength, to fit us for
walking like healthy, strong men in all the ways of
the Lord, and so be fit rightly to fill our place in
the great work of intercession. As we see what the
wholeness is He offers, how He gives it, and what
He asks of us, we shall be prepared for giving a
willing answer to His question.

<h4 class="smc"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">93</span><span class="ns">] </span>
What the Health that Jesus Offers.</h4>

<p>I might mention many marks of spiritual health.
Our text leads us to take one,&mdash;walking. Jesus
said to the sick man, Rise and walk, and with
that restored him to his place among men in full
health and vigour, able to take his part in all the
work of life. It is a wonderfully suggestive picture
of the restoration of spiritual health. To the
healthy, walking is a pleasure; to the sick, a burden,
if not an impossibility. How many Christians
there are to whom, like the maimed and the halt
and the lame and the impotent, movement and
progress in God&#8217;s way is indeed an effort and a
weariness. Christ comes to say, and with the word
He gives the power, Rise and walk.</p>

<p>Just think of this walk to which He restores
and empowers us. It is a life like that of Enoch
and Noah, who &ldquo;walked with God.&rdquo; A life like
that of Abraham, to whom God said, &ldquo;Walk before
Me,&rdquo; and who himself spake, &ldquo;The Lord before
whom I walk.&rdquo; A life of which David sings, &ldquo;They
shall walk in the light of Thy countenance,&rdquo; and
Isaiah prophesies, &ldquo;They that wait on the Lord shall
<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">94</span><span class="ns">] </span>
renew their strength; they shall run and not be
weary, they shall walk and not faint.&rdquo; Even as
God the Creator fainteth not nor is weary, shall
they who walk with Him, waiting on Him, never be
exhausted or feeble. It is a life concerning which
it could be said of the last of the Old Testament
saints, Zacharias and Elisabeth, &ldquo;They were both
righteous before God, walking in all the commandments
and ordinances of the Lord blameless.&rdquo; This
is the walk Jesus came to make possible and true
to His people in greater power than ever before.</p>

<p>Hear what the New Testament speaks of it:
&ldquo;That like as Christ was raised from the dead by
the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in
newness of life.&rdquo; It is the Risen One who says to
us, Rise and walk: He gives the power of the
resurrection life. It is a walk in Christ. &ldquo;As ye
have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye
also in Him.&rdquo; It is a walk like Christ. &ldquo;He that
saith he abideth in Him ought so to walk even as
He walked.&rdquo; It is a walk by the Spirit and after
the Spirit. &ldquo;Walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not
fulfil the lusts of the flesh.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who walk not after
the flesh, but after the Spirit.&rdquo; It is a walk
worthy of God and well pleasing to Him. &ldquo;That
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">95</span><span class="ns">] </span>
ye would walk worthy of the Lord, unto all well
pleasing, being fruitful in every good work.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
beseech you, that as ye received of us, how ye
should walk and please God, <em>even as ye do walk</em>,
that ye would abound more and more.&rdquo; It is a
walk in heavenly love. &ldquo;Walk in love, even as
Christ loved you.&rdquo; It is a &ldquo;walk in the light, as
He is in the light.&rdquo; It is a walk of faith, all its
power coming simply from God and Christ and
the Holy Spirit, to the soul turned away from the
world. &ldquo;We walk by faith, and not by sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How many believers there are who regard such
a walk as an impossible thing&mdash;so impossible that
they do not feel it a sin that they &ldquo;walk otherwise&rdquo;;
and so they do not long for this walk in
newness of life. They have become so accustomed to
the life of impotence, that the life and walk in God&#8217;s
strength has little attraction. But some there are
with whom it is not thus. They do wonder if these
words really mean what they say, and if the wonderful
life each one of them speaks of is simply an unattainable
ideal, or meant to be realised in flesh and
blood. The more they study them, the more they
feel that they are spoken as for daily life. And yet
they appear too high. Oh that they would believe
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">96</span><span class="ns">] </span>
that God sent his Almighty Son, and His Holy
Spirit, indeed to bring us and fit us for a life and
walk from heaven beyond all that man could dare
to think or hope for.</p>

<h4 class="smc">How Jesus Makes Us Whole.</h4>

<p>When a physician heals a patient, he acts on
him from without, and does something which is, if
possible, ever after to render him independent of
his aid. He restores him to perfect health, and
leaves him. With the work of our Lord Jesus it
is in both respects the very opposite. Jesus works
not from without, but from within, by entering
Himself in the power of His Spirit into our very
life. And instead of, as in the bodily healing, being
rendered, if possible, independent of a physician for
the future, Christ&#8217;s one purpose in healing is, as
we said, the exact opposite. His one condition of
success, is to bring us into <em>such dependence upon
Himself as that we shall not be able one single
moment to do without Him</em>. Christ Jesus Himself
is our life, in a sense that many Christians have
no conception of. The prevailing feeble and sickly
life is entirely owing to the lack of the apprehension
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">97</span><span class="ns">] </span>
of the Divine truth, that as long as we
expect Christ continually to do something for us
from heaven, in single acts of grace from time to
time, and each time trust Him to give us what
will last a little while, we cannot be restored to
perfect health. But when once we see how there
is to be nothing of our own for a single moment,
and it is to be all Christ moment by moment, and
learn to accept it from Him and trust Him for it,
the life of Christ becomes the health of our soul.
Health is nothing but life in its normal, undisturbed
action. Christ gives us health by giving us Himself
as our life; so He becomes our strength for our
walk. Isaiah&#8217;s words find their New Testament
fulfilment: They that wait on the Lord shall walk
and not faint, because Christ is now the strength
of their life.</p>

<p>It is strange how believers sometimes think this
life of dependence too great a strain, and a loss of
our personal liberty. They admit a need of dependence,
of much dependence, but with room left for
our own will and energy. They do not see that
even a partial dependence makes us debtors, and
leaves us nothing to boast of. They forget that
our relationship to God, and co-operation with Him,
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">98</span><span class="ns">] </span>
is not that He does the larger part and we the
lesser, but that God does all and we do all&mdash;God
all in us, we all through God. This dependence
upon God secures our true independence; when
our will seeks nothing but the Divine will, we reach
a Divine nobility, the true independence of all that
is created. He that has not seen this must remain
a sickly Christian, letting self do part and Christ part.
He that accepts the life of unceasing dependence
on Christ, as life and health and strength, is made
whole. As God, Christ can enter and become the
life of His creature. As the Glorified One who
received the Holy Spirit from the Father to bestow,
He can renew the heart of the sinful creature
and make it His home, and by His presence maintain
it in full health and strength.</p>

<p>O ye all who would fain walk and please God,
and in your prayer-life not have your heart condemn
you, listen to Christ&#8217;s words: &ldquo;Wilt thou be made
whole?&rdquo; He can give soul-health. He can give a
life that can pray, and know that it is well-pleasing
to the Father. If you would have this, come and
hear how you can receive it.</p>

<h4 class="smc"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">99</span><span class="ns">] </span>
What Christ asks of us.</h4>

<p>The story invites us to notice three things very
specially. Christ&#8217;s question first appeals to the
will, and asks for the expression of its consent.
He then listens to man&#8217;s confession of his utter
helplessness. Then comes the ready obedience
to Christ&#8217;s command, that rises up and walks.</p>

<p>1. Wilt thou be made whole? About the answer
of the impotent man there could be no doubt.
Who would not be willing to have his sickness
removed? But, alas, in the spiritual life what
need to press the question. Some will not admit
that they are so sick. And some will not believe that
Christ can make a man whole. And some will believe
it for others, but they are sure it is not for them.
At the root of all lies the fear of the self-denial and
the sacrifice which will be needed. They are not
willing to forsake entirely the walk after the course
of this world, to give up all self-will, and self-confidence,
and self-pleasing. The walk in Christ
and like Christ is too straight and hard: they do
not will it, they do not will to be made whole.
My brother, if thou art willing, speak it out: &ldquo;Lord!
at any price, I will!&rdquo; From Christ&#8217;s side the act is
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">100</span><span class="ns">] </span>
one of the will: &ldquo;I will, be thou clean.&rdquo; From your
side equally: &ldquo;Be it unto thee as thou wilt.&rdquo; If
you would be delivered from your impotence&mdash;oh,
fear not to say, &ldquo;I will, I will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then comes the second step. Christ wants us
to look up to him as our only Helper. &ldquo;I have no
man to put me in,&rdquo; must be our cry. Here on
earth there is no help for me. Weakness may
grow into strength in the ordinary use of means, if
all the organs and functions are in a sound state.
Sickness needs special measures. Your soul is sick;
your impotence to walk joyfully the Christian walk
in God&#8217;s way is a sign of disease; fear not to confess
it, and to admit that there is no hope for restoration
unless by an act of Christ&#8217;s mercy healing you.
Give up the idea of growing out of your sickly into
a healthy state, of growing out from under the law
into a life under grace. A few days ago I heard a
student plead the cause of the Volunteer Pledge.
&ldquo;The pledge calls you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to a decision.
Do not think of growing into a missionary: unless
God forbids you, take the step; the decision will
bring joy and strength, will set you free to grow up
in all needed for a missionary, and will be a help to
others.&rdquo; It is even so in the Christian life. Delay
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">101</span><span class="ns">] </span>
and struggle will equally hinder you; do confess
that you cannot bring yourself to pray as you would,
because you cannot give yourself the healthy,
heavenly life that loves to pray, and that knows
to count upon God&#8217;s Spirit to pray in us. Come to
Christ to heal you. He can in one moment make
you whole. Not in the sense of working a sudden
change in your feelings, or in what you are in yourself,
but in the heavenly reality of coming in, in
response to your surrender and faith, and taking
charge of your inner life, and filling it with Himself
and Spirit.</p>

<p>The third thing Christ asks is this, the surrender
of faith. When He spoke to the impotent man
His word of command had to be obeyed. The man
believed that there was truth and power in Christ&#8217;s
word; in that faith he rose and walked. By faith
he obeyed. And what Christ said to others was
for him too&mdash;&ldquo;Go thy way; thy faith hath made
thee whole.&rdquo; Of us, too, Christ asks this faith,
that His word changes our impotence into strength,
and fits us for that walk in newness of life for
which we have been quickened in Him. If we do
not believe this, if we will not take courage and say,
with Paul, &ldquo;I can do all things in Christ, which
<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">102</span><span class="ns">] </span>
strengtheneth me,&rdquo; we cannot obey. But if we will
listen to the word that tells us of the walk that is
not only possible, but has been proved and seen in
God&#8217;s saints from of old, if we will fix our eye on
the mighty, living, loving Christ, who speaks in
power, &ldquo;Rise and walk,&rdquo; we shall take courage and
obey. We shall rise and begin to walk in Him
and His strength. In faith, apart from and above
all feeling, we shall accept and trust an unseen
Christ as our strength, and go on in the strength of
the Lord God. We shall know Christ as the
strength of our life. We shall know, and tell, and
prove that Jesus Christ hath made us whole.</p>

<p>Can it indeed be? Yes, it can. He has done it
for many: He will do it for you. Beware of forming
wrong conceptions of what must take place.
When the impotent man was made whole he had
still all to learn as to the use of his new-found
strength. If he wanted to dig, or build, or learn a
trade, he had to begin at the beginning. Do not
expect at once to be a proficient in prayer or any
part of the Christian life. No; but expect and be
confident of this one thing, that, as you have trusted
yourself to Christ to be your health and strength,
He will lead and teach you. Begin to pray in a
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">103</span><span class="ns">] </span>
quiet sense of your ignorance and weakness, but in
a joyful assurance that He will work in you what
you need. Rise and walk each day in a holy confidence
that He is with you and in you. Just accept
Jesus Christ the Living One, and trust Him to do
His work.</p>

<p>Will you do it? Have you done it? Even now
Jesus speaks, &ldquo;Rise and walk.&rdquo; &ldquo;Amen, Lord! at
Thy word I come. I rise to walk with Thee, and
in Thee, and like Thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="start">Here</span> we have a summary of the teaching of
our Lord Jesus on prayer. Nothing will so
much help to convince us of the sin of our remissness
in prayer, to discover its causes, and to give us
courage to expect entire deliverance, as the careful
study and then the believing acceptance of that
teaching. The more heartily we enter into the
mind of our blessed Lord, and set ourselves simply
just to think about prayer as He thought, the more
surely will His words be as living seeds. They will
grow and produce in us their fruit,&mdash;a life and
practice exactly corresponding to the Divine truth
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">105</span><span class="ns">] </span>
they contain. Do let us believe this: Christ, the
living Word of God, gives in His words a Divine
quickening power which brings what they say,
which works in us what He asks, which actually fits
and enables for all He demands. Learn to look
upon His teaching on prayer as a definite promise
of what He, by His Holy Spirit dwelling in you, is
going to work into your very being and character.</p>

<p>Our Lord gives us the five marks, or essential
elements, of true prayer. There must be, first, the
heart&#8217;s <em>desire</em>; then the expression of that desire in
<em>prayer</em>; with that, the <em>faith</em> that carries the prayer
to God; in that faith, the <em>acceptance of God&#8217;s answer</em>;
then comes <em>the experience</em> of the desired blessing.
It may help to give definiteness to our thought, if
we each take a definite request in regard to which
we would fain learn to pray believingly. Or,
perhaps better still, we might all unite and take
the one thing that has been occupying our attention.
We have been speaking of failure in prayer;
why should we not take as the object of desire and
supplication the &ldquo;grace of supplication,&rdquo; and say,
I want to ask and receive in faith the power to
pray just as, and as much as, my God expects of
me? Let us meditate on our Lord&#8217;s words, in the
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">106</span><span class="ns">] </span>
confidence that He will teach us how to pray for
this blessing.</p>

<p>1. &ldquo;What things soever <em>ye desire</em>.&rdquo;&mdash;Desire is the
secret power that moves the whole world of living
men, and directs the course of each. And so desire
is the soul of prayer, and the cause of insufficient
or unsuccessful prayer is very much to be found in
the lack or feebleness of desire. Some may doubt
this: they are sure that they have very earnestly
desired what they ask. But if they consider
whether their desire has indeed been as whole-hearted
as God would have it, as the heavenly
worth of these blessings demands, they may come
to see that it was indeed the lack of desire that was
the cause of failure. What is true of God is true
of each of his blessings, and is the more true the
more spiritual the blessing: &ldquo;Ye shall seek Me,
and shall find, when ye shall search for Me with all
your heart&rdquo; (Jer. xxix.&nbsp;13). Of Judah in the days
of Asa it is written, &ldquo;They sought Him with <em>their
whole desire</em>&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Chron. xv.&nbsp;15). A Christian may
often have very earnest desires for spiritual blessings.
But alongside of these there are other desires
in his daily life occupying a large place in his
interests and affections. The spiritual desires are
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">107</span><span class="ns">] </span>
not all-absorbing. He wonders that his prayer is
not heard. It is simply that God wants the whole
heart. &ldquo;The Lord thy God is <em>one Lord</em>, therefore
thou shalt love the Lord thy God with <em>all thy
heart</em>.&rdquo; The law is unchangeable: God offers
Himself, gives Himself away, to the whole-hearted
who give themselves wholly away to Him. He
always gives us according to our heart&#8217;s desire.
But not as we think it, but as He sees it. If there
be other desires which are more at home with us,
which have our heart more than Himself and His
presence, He allows these to be fulfilled, and the
desires that engage us at the hour of prayer cannot
be granted.</p>

<p>We desire the gift of intercession, grace and
power to pray aright. Our hearts must be drawn
away from other desires: we must give ourselves
wholly to this one. We must be willing to live
wholly in intercession for the kingdom. By fixing
our eye on the blessedness and the need of this
grace, by thinking of the certainty that God will
give it us, by giving ourselves up to it, for the
sake of the perishing world, desire may be
strengthened, and the first step taken towards the
possession of the coveted blessing. Let us seek
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">108</span><span class="ns">] </span>
the grace of prayer, as we seek the God with
whom it will link us, &ldquo;with our whole desire&rdquo;;
we may depend upon the promise, &ldquo;He will fulfil
the desire of them that fear Him.&rdquo; Let us not fear
to say to Him, &ldquo;I desire it with my whole heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. &ldquo;What things soever ye desire when <em>ye pray</em>.&rdquo;&mdash;The
desire of the heart must become the expression
of the lips. Our Lord Jesus more than once asked
those who cried to Him for mercy, &ldquo;What wilt
thou?&rdquo; He wanted them to say what they would.
To speak it out roused their whole being into
action, brought them into contact with Him, and
wakened their expectation. To pray is to enter
into God&#8217;s presence, to claim and secure His
attention, to have distinct dealing with Him in
regard to some request, to commit our need to His
faithfulness and to leave it there: it is in so doing
that we become fully conscious of what we are
seeking.</p>

<p>There are some who often carry strong desires
in their heart, without bringing them to God in the
clear expression of definite and repeated prayer.
There are others who go to the Word and its
promises to strengthen their faith, but do not give
sufficient place to that pointed asking of God which
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">109</span><span class="ns">] </span>
helps the soul to the assurance that the matter has
been put into God&#8217;s hands. Still others come in
prayer with so many requests and desires, that it is
difficult for themselves to say what they really
expect God to do. If you would obtain from God
this great gift of faithfulness in prayer and power
to pray aright, begin by exercising yourself in
prayer in regard to it. Say of it to yourself and
to God: &ldquo;Here is something I have asked, and am
continuing to ask till I receive. As plain and
pointed as words can make it, I am saying, &lsquo;My
Father! I do desire, I do ask of Thee, and expect
of Thee, the grace of prayer and intercession.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>3. &ldquo;What things soever ye desire, when ye pray,
<em>believe</em>.&rdquo;&mdash;As it is only by faith that we can know
God, or receive Jesus Christ, or live the Christian
life, so faith is the life and power of prayer. If
we are to enter upon a life of intercession, in which
there is to be joy and power and blessing, if we are
to have our prayer for the grace of prayer answered,
we must learn anew what faith is, and begin to live
and pray in faith as never before.</p>

<p>Faith is the opposite of sight, and the two are
contrary the one to the other. &ldquo;We walk by faith,
and not by sight.&rdquo; If the unseen is to get full
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">110</span><span class="ns">] </span>
possession of us, and heart and life and prayer are
to be full of faith, there must be a withdrawal from,
a denial of, the visible. The spirit that seeks to
enjoy as much as possible of what is innocent or
legitimate, that gives the first place to the calls and
duties of daily life, is inconsistent with a strong
faith and close intercourse with the spiritual world.
&ldquo;We <em>look not</em> at the things that are seen&rdquo;&mdash;the
negative side needs to be emphasised if the positive,
&ldquo;but at the things which are not seen,&rdquo; is to become
natural to us. In praying, faith depends upon our
living in the invisible world.</p>

<p>This faith has specially to do with God.
The great reason of our lack of faith is our lack
of knowledge of God and intercourse with Him.
&ldquo;Have faith in God,&rdquo; Jesus said when He spoke
of removing mountains. It is as a soul
knows God, is occupied with His power, love,
and faithfulness, comes away out of self and
the world, and allows the light of God to shine
on it, that unbelief will become impossible. All
the mysteries and difficulties connected with
answers to prayer will, however little we may
be able to solve them intellectually, be swallowed
up in the adoring assurance: &ldquo;This God is our
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">111</span><span class="ns">] </span>
God. He will bless us. He does indeed answer
prayer. And the grace to pray I am asking for
He will delight to give.&rdquo; (<a name="nta.C" id="nta.C" href="#nt.C">Note C.</a>)</p>

<p>4. &ldquo;What things soever ye desire, when ye
pray, believe that <em>ye have received</em>,&rdquo; now as you
pray.&mdash;<em>Faith has to accept the answer, as given by
God in heaven, before it is found or felt upon earth.</em>
This point causes difficulty, and yet it is of the
very essence of believing prayer, its real secret.
Try and take it in. Spiritual things can only
be spiritually apprehended or appropriated. The
spiritual heavenly blessing of God&#8217;s answer to
your prayer must be spiritually recognised and
accepted before you feel anything of it. It is
faith does this. A soul that not only seeks an
answer, but seeks first the God who gives the
answer, receives the power to know that it has
what it has asked of Him. If it knows that it
has asked according to His will and promises,
and that it has come to and found Himself to
give it, it does believe that it has received. &ldquo;We
know that He heareth us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is nothing so heart-searching as this
faith, &ldquo;<em>Believe that ye have received.</em>&rdquo; As we strive
to believe, and find we cannot, it leads us to
<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">112</span><span class="ns">] </span>
discover what there is that hinders. Blessed
is the man who holds nothing back, and lets
nothing hold him back, but, with his eye and
heart on God alone, refuses to rest till he has
believed what our Lord bids him, &ldquo;that he has
received.&rdquo; Here is the place where Jacob
becomes Israel, and the power of prevailing
prayer is born out of human weakness and
despair. Here comes in the real need for persevering
and ever-importunate prayer, that will
not rest, or go away, or give up, till it knows
it is heard, and believes that it has received.</p>

<p>You pray for &ldquo;the Spirit of grace and supplication&rdquo;?
As you ask for it in strong desire, and
believe in God who hears prayer, do not be afraid
to press on and believe that your life can indeed
be changed, that the world with its press of
duties, whether religious or not, hindering prayer,
can be overcome, and that God gives you your
heart&#8217;s desire, grace to pray both in measure
and in spirit, just as the Father would have
His child do. &ldquo;Believe that you have received.&rdquo;</p>

<p>5. &ldquo;What things soever ye desire, when ye pray,
believe that ye have received, and <em>ye shall have
them</em>.&rdquo;&mdash;The receiving from God in faith, the
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">113</span><span class="ns">] </span>
believing acceptance of the answer with the
perfect, praising assurance that it has been given,
is not necessarily the experience or subjective
possession of the gift we have asked for. At
times there may be a considerable, or even a long,
interval. In other cases the believing supplicant
may at once enter upon the actual enjoyment
of what he has received. It is specially in the
former case that we have need of faith and
patience: faith to rejoice in the assurance of
the answer bestowed and received, and to begin
and act upon that answer though nothing be
felt; patience to wait if there be for the present
no sensible proof of its presence. We can count
upon it: <em>Ye shall have</em>, in actual enjoyment.</p>

<p>If we apply this to the prayer for the power of
faithful intercession, the grace to pray earnestly
and perseveringly for souls around us, let us learn
to hold fast the Divine assurance that, as surely as
we believe we receive, and that faith therefore,
apart from all failing, may rejoice in the certainty
of an answered prayer. The more we praise God
for it, the sooner will the experience come. We
may begin at once to pray for others, in the
confidence that grace will be given us to pray more
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">114</span><span class="ns">] </span>
perseveringly and more believingly than we have
done before. If we do not find any special
enlargement or power in prayer, this must not
hinder or discourage us. We have accepted, apart
from feeling, a spiritual Divine gift by faith; in
that faith we are to pray, nothing doubting. The
Holy Spirit may for a little time be hiding Himself
within us; we may count upon Him, even though
it be with groanings which cannot find expression,
to pray in us; in due time we shall become
conscious of His presence and power. As sure as
there is desire and prayer and faith, and faith&#8217;s
acceptance of the gift, there will be, too, the
manifestation and experience of the blessing we
sought.</p>

<p>Beloved brother! do you truly desire that God
should enable you so to pray that your life may be
free from continual self-condemnation, and that
the power of His Spirit may come down in answer
to your petition? Come and <em>ask it of God</em>. Kneel
down and pray for it in a single definite sentence.
When you have done so, kneel still in faith,
believing in God who answers. Believe that you
do now receive what you have prayed: believe that
you have received. If you find it difficult to do
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">115</span><span class="ns">] </span>
this, kneel still, and say that you do it on the
strength of His own word. If it cost time, and
struggle, and doubt&mdash;fear not; at His feet, looking
up into His face, faith will come. &ldquo;Believe that
you have received&rdquo;: at His bidding you dare
claim the answer. Begin in that faith, even though
it be feeble, a new prayer-life, with this one
thought as its strength: &ldquo;You have asked and
received grace in Christ to prepare you, step by
step, to be faithful in prayer and intercession. The
more simply you hold to this, and expect the
Holy Spirit to work it in you, the more surely and
fully will the word be made true to you: Ye shall
have it. God Himself who gave the answer will
work it in you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="start">The</span> Holy Spirit has been given to every child
of God to be his life. He dwells in him,
not as a separate Being in one part of his nature,
but as his very life. He is the Divine power or
energy by which his life is maintained and
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">117</span><span class="ns">] </span>
strengthened. All that a believer is called to be or
to do, the Holy Spirit can and will work in him. If
he does not know or yield to the Holy Guest, the
Blessed Spirit cannot work, and his life is a sickly
one, full of failure and of sin. As he yields, and
waits, and obeys the leading of the Spirit, God
works in him all that is pleasing in His sight.</p>

<p>This Holy Spirit is, in the first place, a Spirit of
prayer. He was promised as a &ldquo;Spirit of grace
and supplication,&rdquo; the grace for supplication. He
was sent forth into our hearts as &ldquo;the Spirit of
adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.&rdquo; He
enables us to say, in true faith and growing apprehension
of its meaning, Our Father which art in
heaven. &ldquo;He maketh intercession for the saints
according to God.&rdquo; And as we pray in the Spirit,
our worship is as God seeks it to be, &ldquo;in spirit
and in truth.&rdquo; Prayer is just the breathing of the
Spirit in us; power in prayer comes from the
power of the Spirit in us, waited on and trusted in.
Failure in prayer comes from feebleness of the
Spirit&#8217;s work in us. Our prayer is the index of
the measure of the Spirit&#8217;s work in us. To pray
aright, the life of the Spirit must be right in us.
For praying the effectual, much-availing prayer of
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">118</span><span class="ns">] </span>
the righteous man everything depends on being full
of the Spirit.</p>

<p>There are three very simple lessons that the
believer, who would enjoy the blessing of being
taught to pray by the Spirit of prayer, must know.
The first is: <em>Believe that the Spirit dwells in you</em>
(Eph. i.&nbsp;13). Deep in the inmost recesses of his
being, hidden and unfelt, every child of God has
the Holy, Mighty Spirit of God dwelling in him.
He knows it by faith, the faith that, accepting God&#8217;s
word, realises that of which he sees as yet no sign.
&ldquo;We receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.&rdquo;
As long as we measure our power, for praying
aright and perseveringly, by what we feel, or think
we can accomplish, we shall be discouraged when
we hear of how much we ought to pray. But
when we quietly believe that, in the midst of all
our conscious weakness, the Holy Spirit as a Spirit
of supplication is dwelling within us, <em>for the very
purpose of enabling us to pray in such manner and
measure as God would have us</em>, our hearts will be
filled with hope. We shall be strengthened in the
assurance which lies at the very root of a happy and
fruitful Christian life, that <em>God has made an abundant
provision for our being what He wants us to be</em>.
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">119</span><span class="ns">] </span>
We shall begin to lose our sense of burden and
fear and discouragement about our ever praying
sufficiently, because we see that the Holy Spirit
Himself will pray, is praying, in us.</p>

<p>The second lesson is: <em>Beware above everything of
grieving the Holy Spirit</em> (Eph. iv.&nbsp;30). If you do,
how can He work in you the quiet, trustful, and
blessed sense of that union with Christ which makes
your prayers well pleasing to the Father? Beware of
grieving Him by sin, by unbelief, by selfishness, by
unfaithfulness to His voice in conscience. Do not
think grieving Him a necessity: that cuts away
the very sinews of your strength. Do not consider
it impossible to obey the command, &ldquo;Grieve not
the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; He Himself is the very power
of God to make you obedient. The sin that comes
up in you against your will, the tendency to sloth, or
pride, or self-will, or passion that rises in the flesh,
your will can, in the power of the Spirit, at once
reject, and cast upon Christ and His blood, and
your communion with God is immediately restored.
Accept each day the Holy Spirit as your Leader
and Life and Strength; you can count upon Him
to do in your heart all that ought to be done there.
He, the Unseen and Unfelt One, but known by
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">120</span><span class="ns">] </span>
faith, gives there, unseen and unfelt, the love
and the faith and the power of obedience you need,
because He reveals Christ unseen within you, as
actually your Life and Strength. Grieve not the
Holy Spirit by distrusting Him, because you do not
feel His presence in you.</p>

<p>Especially in the matter of prayer grieve Him
not. Do not expect, when you trust Christ to
bring you into a new, healthy prayer-life, that
you will be able all at once to pray as easily and
powerfully and joyfully as you fain would. No;
it may not come at once. But just bow quietly
before God in your ignorance and weakness. That
is the best and truest prayer, to put yourself
before God just as you are, and to count on the
hidden Spirit praying in you. &ldquo;We know not
what to pray as we ought&rdquo;; ignorance, difficulty,
struggle, marks our prayer all along. But, &ldquo;the
Spirit helpeth our infirmities.&rdquo; How? &ldquo;The
Spirit Himself,&rdquo; deeper down than our thoughts
or feelings, &ldquo;maketh intercession for us with
groanings which cannot be uttered.&rdquo; When you
cannot find words, when your words appear cold
and feeble, just believe: The Holy Spirit is praying
in me. Be quiet before God, and give Him time
<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">121</span><span class="ns">] </span>
and opportunity; in due season you will learn to
pray. Beware of grieving the Spirit of prayer,
by not honouring Him in patient, trustful
surrender to His intercession in you.</p>

<p>The third lesson: &ldquo;<em>Be filled with the Spirit</em>&rdquo; (Eph.
v.&nbsp;18). I think that we have seen the meaning of
the great truth: It is only the healthy spiritual life
that can pray aright. The command comes to each
of us: &ldquo;Be filled with the Spirit.&rdquo; That implies that
while some rest content with the beginning, with
a small measure of the Spirit&#8217;s working, it is God&#8217;s
will that we should be filled with the Spirit. That
means, from our side, that our whole being ought
to be entirely yielded up to the Holy Spirit, to be
possessed and controlled by Him alone. And, from
God&#8217;s side, that we may count upon and expect
the Holy Spirit to take possession and fill us.
Has not our failure in prayer evidently been owing
to our not having accepted the Spirit of prayer to
be our life; to our not having yielded wholly
to Him, whom the Father gave as the Spirit of His
Son, to work the life of the Son in us? Let us,
to say the very least, be willing to receive Him,
to yield ourselves to God and trust Him for it.
Let us not again wilfully grieve the Holy Spirit by
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">122</span><span class="ns">] </span>
declining, by neglecting, by hesitating to seek
to have Him as fully as He is willing to give
Himself to us. If we have at all seen that
prayer is the great need of our work and of
the Church, if we have at all desired or resolved
to pray more, let us turn to the very
source of all power and blessing&mdash;let us believe
that the Spirit of prayer, even in His fulness,
is for us.</p>

<p>We all admit the place the Father and the Son
have in our prayer. It is to the Father we pray,
and from whom we expect the answer. It is in
the merit, and name, and life of the Son, abiding
in Him and He in us, that we trust to be heard.
But have we understood that in the Holy Trinity
all the Three Persons have an equal place in prayer,
and that the faith in the Holy Spirit of intercession
as praying in us is as indispensable as the faith
in the Father and the Son? How clearly we have
this in the words, &ldquo;Through Christ we have access
by one Spirit to the Father.&rdquo; As much as prayer
must be <em>to</em> the Father, and <em>through</em> the Son, it must
be <em>by</em> the Spirit. And the Spirit can pray in no
other way in us, than as He lives in us. It is only
as we give ourselves to the Spirit living and
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">123</span><span class="ns">] </span>
praying in us, that the glory of the prayer-hearing
God, and the ever-blessed and most effectual
mediation of the Son, can be known by us in their
power. (<a name="nta.D" id="nta.D" href="#nt.D">Note D.</a>)</p>

<p>Our last lesson: <em>Pray in the Spirit for all saints</em>
(Eph. vi.&nbsp;18). The Spirit, who is called &ldquo;the Spirit
of supplication,&rdquo; is also and very specially the Spirit
of intercession. It is said of Him, &ldquo;the Spirit
Himself maketh intercession for us with groanings
that cannot be uttered.&rdquo; &ldquo;He maketh intercession
for the saints.&rdquo; It is the same word as is used
of Christ, &ldquo;who also maketh intercession for us.&rdquo;
The thought is essentially that of mediation&mdash;one
pleading for another. When the Spirit of intercession
takes full possession of us, all selfishness,
as if we wanted Him separate from His intercession
for others, and have Him for ourselves alone, is
banished, and we begin to avail ourselves of our
wonderful privilege to plead for men. We long
to live the Christ-life of self-consuming sacrifice
for others, as our heart unceasingly yields itself
to God to obtain His blessing for those around us.
Intercession then becomes, not an incident or an
occasional part of our prayers, but their one great
object. Prayer for ourselves then takes its true
<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">124</span><span class="ns">] </span>
place, simply as a means for fitting us better
for exercising our ministry of intercession more
effectually.</p>

<p>May I be allowed to speak a very personal word
to each of my readers? I have humbly besought
God to give me what I may give them&mdash;Divine
light and help truly to forsake the life of failure in
prayer, and to enter, even now, and at once, upon
the life of intercession which the Holy Spirit can
enable them to lead. It can be done by a simple
act of faith, claiming the fulness of the Spirit, that
is, the full measure of the Spirit which you are
capable in God&#8217;s sight of receiving, and He is
therefore willing to bestow. Will you not, even
now, accept of this by faith?</p>

<p>Let me remind you of what takes place at
conversion. Most of us, you probably too, for a
time sought peace in efforts and struggles to give
up sin and please God. But you did not find it
thus. The peace of God&#8217;s pardon came by faith,
trusting God&#8217;s word concerning Christ and His
salvation. You had heard of Christ as the gift of
His love, you knew that He was for you too, you
had felt the movings and drawings of His grace;
but never till in faith in God&#8217;s word you accepted
<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">125</span><span class="ns">] </span>
Him as God&#8217;s gift to you, did you know the peace
and joy that He can give. Believing in Him
and His saving love made all the difference, and
changed your relation from one who had ever
grieved Him, to one who loved and served Him.
And yet, after a time, you have a thousand times
wondered you love and serve Him so ill.</p>

<p>At the time of your conversion you knew little
about the Holy Spirit. Later on you heard of His
dwelling in you, and His being the power of God
in you for all the Father intends you to be, and
yet His indwelling and inworking have been something
vague and indefinite, and hardly a source
of joy or strength. At conversion you did not yet
know your need of Him, and still less what you
might expect of Him. But your failures have
taught it you. And now you begin to see how you
have been grieving Him, by not trusting and not
following Him, by not allowing Him to work in you
all God&#8217;s pleasure.</p>

<p>All this can be changed. Just as you, after
seeking Christ, and praying to Him, and trying
without success to serve Him, found rest in accepting
Him by faith, just so you may even now yield
yourself to the full guidance of the Holy Spirit,
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">126</span><span class="ns">] </span>
and claim and accept Him to work in you what
God would have. Will you not do it? Just
accept Him in faith as Christ&#8217;s gift, to be the
Spirit of your whole life, of your prayer-life too,
and you can count upon Him to take charge. You
can then begin, however feeble you feel, and unable
to pray aright, to bow before God in silence,
with the assurance that He will teach you to
pray.</p>

<p>My dear brother, as you consciously by faith
accepted Christ, to pardon, you can consciously
now in the like faith accept of Christ who gives
the Holy Spirit to do His work in you. &ldquo;Christ
redeemed us that we might receive the promise of
the Spirit by faith.&rdquo; Kneel down, and simply
believe that the Lord Christ, who baptizeth with
the Holy Spirit, does now, in response to your
faith, begin in you the blessed life of a full experience
of the power of the indwelling Spirit.
Depend most confidently upon Him, apart from
all feeling or experience, as the Spirit of supplication
and intercession to do His work. Renew that
act of faith each morning, each time you pray;
trust Him, against all appearances, to work in you,&mdash;be
sure He is working,&mdash;and He will give you
<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">127</span><span class="ns">] </span>
to know what the joy of the Holy Spirit is as the
power of your life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will pour out the Spirit of supplication.&rdquo;
Do you not begin to see that the mystery of prayer
is the mystery of the Divine indwelling. God in
heaven gives His Spirit in our hearts to be there
the Divine power praying in us, and drawing us
upward to our God. God is a Spirit, and nothing
but a like life and Spirit within us can hold
communion with Him. It was for this man was
created, that God might dwell and work in Him, and
be the life of his life. It was this Divine indwelling
that sin lost. It was this that Christ came to
exhibit in His life, to win back for us in His death,
and then to impart to us by coming again from
heaven in the Spirit to live in His disciples. It
is this, the indwelling of God through the Spirit,
that alone can explain and enable us to appropriate
the wonderful promises given to prayer. God gives
the Spirit as a Spirit of Supplication, too, to maintain
His Divine life within us as a life out of which
prayer ever rises upward.</p>

<p>Without the Holy Spirit no man can call Jesus
Lord, or cry, Abba, Father; no man can worship in
spirit and truth, or pray without ceasing. The
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">128</span><span class="ns">] </span>
Holy Spirit is given the believer to be and do in
him all that God wants him to be or do. He is
given him especially as the Spirit of prayer and
supplication. Is it not clear that everything in
prayer depends upon our trusting the Holy Spirit
to do His work in us; yielding ourselves to His
leading, depending only and wholly on Him?</p>

<p>We read, &ldquo;Stephen was a man full of faith and
the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The two ever go together, in
exact proportion to each other. As our faith sees
and trusts the Spirit in us to pray, and waits on
Him, He will do His work; and it is the longing
desire, and the earnest supplication, and the definite
faith the Father seeks. Do let us know Him, and
in the faith of Christ who unceasingly gives Him,
cultivate the assured confidence, we can learn to
pray as the Father would have us.</p>

Lord knew how slow our hearts would be
to take it in, and He so longed that we should
really believe that His Name is the power in which
every knee should bow, and in which every prayer
could be heard, that He did not weary of saying
it over and over: <em>In My Name!</em> Between the
wonderful <em>whatsoever ye shall ask</em>, and the Divine <em>I
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">130</span><span class="ns">] </span>
will do it, the Father will give it</em>, this one word is
the simple link: <em>In My Name.</em> Our asking and
the Father&#8217;s giving are to be equally in the Name of
Christ. Everything in prayer depends upon our
apprehending this&mdash;<em>In My Name.</em></p>

<p>We know what a name is: a word by which we
call up to our mind the whole being and nature
of an object. When I speak of a lamb or a lion,
the name at once suggests the different nature
peculiar to each. The Name of God is meant to
express His whole Divine nature and glory. And
so the Name of Christ means His whole nature,
His person and work, His disposition and Spirit.
To ask in the Name of Christ is to pray in union
with Him. When first a sinner believes in Christ,
he only knows and thinks of His merit and intercession.
And to the very end that is the one
foundation of our confidence. And yet, as the
believer grows in grace and enters more deeply
and truly into union with Christ&mdash;that is, as he
abides in Him&mdash;he learns that to pray in the
Name of Christ also means in His Spirit, and in
the possession of His nature, as the Holy Spirit
imparts it to us. As we grasp the meaning of the
words, &ldquo;<em>At that day</em> ye shall ask in My Name&rdquo;&mdash;the
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">131</span><span class="ns">] </span>
day when in the Holy Spirit Christ came to
live in His disciples&mdash;we shall no longer be staggered
at the greatness of the promise: &ldquo;<em>Whatsoever</em> ye
shall ask in My Name, I will do it.&rdquo; We shall
get some insight into the unchangeable necessity
and certainty of the law: what is asked in the
Name of Christ, in union with Him, out of His
nature and Spirit, must be given. As Christ&#8217;s
prayer-nature lives in us, His prayer-power becomes
ours too. Not that the measure of our attainment
or experience is the ground of our confidence, but
the honesty and whole-heartedness of our surrender
to all that we see that Christ seeks to be in us, will
be the measure of our spiritual fitness and power
to pray in His Name. &ldquo;If ye abide in Me,&rdquo; He
says, &ldquo;ye shall ask what ye will.&rdquo; As we live in
Him, we get the spiritual power to avail ourselves of
His Name. As the branch wholly given up to the
life and service of the Vine can count upon all
its sap and strength for its fruit, so the believer,
who in faith has accepted the fulness of the Spirit
to possess his whole life, can indeed avail himself
of all the power of Christ&#8217;s Name.</p>

<p>Here on earth Christ as man came to reveal
what prayer is. To pray in the Name of Christ we
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">132</span><span class="ns">] </span>
must pray as He prayed on earth; as He
taught us to pray; in union with Him, as He
now prays in heaven. We must in love study, and
in faith accept, Him as our Example, our Teacher,
our Intercessor.</p>

<h4 class="smc">Christ our Example.</h4>

<p>Prayer in Christ on earth and in us cannot be
two different things. Just as there is but one God,
who is a Spirit, who hears prayer, there is but one
spirit of acceptable prayer. When we realise what
time Christ spent in prayer, and how the great
events of His life were all connected with special
prayer, we learn the necessity of absolute dependence
on and unceasing direct communication with the
heavenly world, if we are to live a heavenly life, or
to exercise heavenly power around us. We see
how foolish and fruitless the attempt must be to do
work for God and heaven, without in the first place
in prayer getting the life and the power of heaven to
possess us. Unless this truth lives in us, we cannot
avail ourselves aright of the mighty power of the
Name of Christ. His example must teach us the
meaning of His Name.</p>

<p><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">133</span><span class="ns">] </span>
Of His baptism we read, &ldquo;Jesus having been
baptized, <em>and praying</em>, the heaven was opened.&rdquo; It
was in prayer heaven was opened to Him, that
heaven came down to Him with the Spirit and
the voice of the Father. In the power of these
He was led into the wilderness, in fasting and
prayer to have them tested and fully appropriated.
Early in His ministry Mark records
(i.&nbsp;35), &ldquo;And in the morning, a great while before
day, He rose and departed into a desert place, <em>and
there prayed</em>.&rdquo; And somewhat later Luke tells
(v.&nbsp;16), &ldquo;Multitudes came together to hear and to
be healed. <em>But He withdrew Himself into the desert,
and prayed.</em>&rdquo; He knew how the holiest service,
preaching and healing, can exhaust the spirit; how
too much intercourse with men could cloud the
fellowship with God; how time, time, full time, is
needed if the spirit is to rest and root in Him; how
no pressure of duty among men can free from
the absolute need of much prayer. If anyone
could have been satisfied with always living and
working in the spirit of prayer, it would have been
our Master. But He could not; He needed to
have His supplies replenished by continual and long-continued
seasons of prayer. To use Christ&#8217;s Name
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">134</span><span class="ns">] </span>
in prayer surely includes this, to follow His example
and to pray as He did.</p>

<p>Of the night before choosing His apostles we
read (Luke vi.&nbsp;12), &ldquo;He went out into the mountain
<em>to pray, and continued all night in prayer to
God</em>.&rdquo; The first step towards the constitution of
the Church, and the separation of men to be His
witnesses and successors, called Him to special long-continued
prayer. All had to be done according
to the pattern on the mount. &ldquo;The Son can do
nothing of Himself: the Father showeth Him all
things that Himself doeth.&rdquo; It was in the night
of prayer it was shown Him.</p>

<p>In the night between the feeding of the five
thousand, when Jesus knew that they wanted to
take Him by force and make Him King, and the
walking on the sea, &ldquo;He withdrew again into the
mountain, Himself alone, <em>to pray</em>&rdquo; (Matt. xiv.&nbsp;23;
Mark vi.&nbsp;46; John vi.&nbsp;15). It was God&#8217;s will He
was come to do, and God&#8217;s power He was to show
forth. He had it not as a possession of His own;
it had to be prayed for and received from above.
The first announcement of His approaching death,
after He had elicited from Peter the confession that
He was the Christ, is introduced by the words
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">135</span><span class="ns">] </span>
(Luke ix.&nbsp;15), &ldquo;And it came to pass that <em>He was
praying alone</em>.&rdquo; The introduction to the story of
the Transfiguration is (Luke ix.&nbsp;28), &ldquo;He went up
into the mountain <em>to pray</em>.&rdquo; The request of the
disciples, &ldquo;Lord, teach us to pray&rdquo; (Luke xi.&nbsp;1), follows
on, &ldquo;It came to pass <em>as He was praying</em> in a certain
place.&rdquo; In His own personal life, in His intercourse
with the Father, in all He is and does for
men, the Christ whose name we are to use is a
Man of prayer. It is prayer gives Him His power
of blessing, and transfigures His very body with the
glory of heaven. It is His own prayer-life makes
Him the teacher of others how to pray. How
much more must it be prayer, prayer alone, much
prayer, that can fit us to share His glory of a transfigured
life, or make us the channel of heavenly
blessing and teaching to others. To pray in the
Name of Christ is to pray as He prays.</p>

<p>As the end approaches, it is still more prayer.
When the Greeks asked to see Him, and He spoke
of His approaching death, He prayed. At Lazarus&#8217;
grave He prayed. In the last night He prayed
His prayer as our High-Priest, that we might
know what His sacrifice would win, and what His
everlasting intercession on the throne would be. In
<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">136</span><span class="ns">] </span>
Gethsemane He prayed His prayer as Victim, the
Lamb giving itself to the slaughter. On the Cross
it is still all prayer&mdash;the prayer of compassion for
His murderers; the prayer of atoning suffering in
the thick darkness; the prayer in death of confiding
resignation of His spirit to the Father. <a name="nta.E" id="nta.E" href="#nt.E">Note E.</a>)</p>

<p>Christ&#8217;s life and work, His suffering and death&mdash;it
was all prayer, all dependence on God, trust in God,
receiving from God, surrender to God. Thy redemption,
O believer, is a redemption wrought out by prayer
and intercession: thy Christ is a praying Christ:
the life He lived for thee, the life He lives in thee,
is a praying life, that delights to wait on God and
receive all from Him. To pray in His Name is to
pray as He prayed. Christ is only our example because
He is our Head, our Saviour, and our Life.
In virtue of His Deity and of His Spirit He can
live in us: we can pray in His Name, because we
abide in Him and He in us.</p>

<h4 class="smc">Christ our Teacher.</h4>

<p>Christ was what He taught. All His teaching
was just the revelation of how He lived, and&mdash;praise
God&mdash;of the life He was to live in us. His
teaching of the disciples was first to awaken desire,
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">137</span><span class="ns">] </span>
and so prepare them for what He would by the Holy
Spirit be and work in them. Let us believe very
confidently: all He was in prayer, and all He
taught, He Himself will give. He came to fulfil
the law; much more will He fulfil the gospel in
all He taught us, as to what to pray, and how.</p>

<p><em>What to pray.</em>&mdash;It has sometimes been said that
direct petitions, as compared with the exercise of
fellowship with God, are but a subordinate part of
prayer, and that &ldquo;in the prayer of those who pray
best and most, they occupy but an inconsiderable
place.&rdquo; If we carefully study all that our Lord
spoke of prayer, we shall see that this is not His
teaching. In the Lord&#8217;s Prayer, in the parables on
prayer, in the illustration of a child asking bread,
of our seeking and knocking, in the central thought
of the prayer of faith, &ldquo;Whatsoever ye pray,
believe that ye have received,&rdquo; in the oft-repeated
&ldquo;<em>whatsoever</em>&rdquo; of the last evening&mdash;everywhere our
Lord urges and encourages us to offer definite
petitions, and to expect definite answers. It is
only because we have too much confined prayer to
our own needs, that it has been thought needful to
free it from the appearance of selfishness, by giving
the petitions a subordinate place. If once believers
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">138</span><span class="ns">] </span>
were to awake to the glory of the work of intercession,
and to see that in it, and the definite
pleading for definite gifts on definite spheres and
persons, lie our highest fellowship with our glorified
Lord, and our only real power to bless men, it would
be seen that there can be no truer fellowship with
God than these definite petitions and their answers,
by which we become the channel of His grace and
life to men. Then our fellowship with the Father
is even such as the Son has in His intercession.</p>

<p><em>How to pray.</em>&mdash;Our Lord taught us to pray in
secret, in simplicity, with the eye on God alone, in
humility, in the spirit of forgiving love. But the
chief truth He reiterated was ever this: to pray
in faith. And He defined that faith, not only as
a trust in God&#8217;s goodness or power, but as the
definite assurance that we have received the very
thing we ask. And then, in view of the delay
in the answer, He insisted on perseverance and
urgency. We must be followers of those &ldquo;who
through faith and patience inherit the promises&rdquo;&mdash;the
faith that accepts the promise, and knows
it has what it has asked&mdash;the patience that obtains
the promise and inherits the blessing. We shall
then learn to understand why God, who promises to
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">139</span><span class="ns">] </span>
avenge His elect speedily, bears with them in seeming
delay. It is that their faith may be purified from all
that is of the flesh, and tested and strengthened to
become that spiritual power that can do all things&mdash;can
even cast mountains into the heart of the sea.</p>

<h4 class="smc">Christ as our Intercessor.</h4>

<p>We have gazed on Christ in His prayers; we
have listened to His teaching as to how we must
pray; to know fully what it is to pray in His
Name, we must know Him too in His heavenly
intercession.</p>

<p>Just think what it means: that all His saving
work wrought from heaven is still carried on, just
as on earth, in unceasing communication with, and
direct intercession to the Father, who worketh all
in all, who is All in All. Every act of grace in
Christ has been preceded by, and owes its power
to, intercession. God has been honoured and
acknowledged as its Author. On the throne of God,
Christ&#8217;s highest fellowship with the Father, and
His partnership in His rule of the world, is in
intercession. Every blessing that comes down to
us from above bears upon it the stamp from
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">140</span><span class="ns">] </span>
God: through Christ&#8217;s intercession. His intercession
is nothing but the fruit and the glory of
His atonement. When He gave Himself a sacrifice
to God for men, He proved that His whole
heart had the one object: the glory of God, in the
salvation of men. In His intercession this great
purpose is realised: He glorifies the Father by
asking and receiving all of Him; He saves men by
bestowing what He has obtained from the Father.
Christ&#8217;s intercession is the Father&#8217;s glory, His own
glory, our glory.</p>

<p>And now, this Christ, the Intercessor, is our life; He
is our Head, and we are His body; His Spirit
and life breathe in us. As in heaven so on earth,
intercession is God&#8217;s chosen, God&#8217;s only channel of
blessing. Let us learn from Christ what glory there
is in it; what the way to exercise this wondrous
power; what the part it is to take in work for God.</p>

<p><em>The glory of it.</em>&mdash;By it, beyond anything, we
glorify God. By it we glorify Christ. By it we
bring blessing to the Church and the world. By
it we obtain our highest nobility&mdash;the Godlike
power of saving men.</p>

<p><em>The way to it.</em>&mdash;Paul writes, &ldquo;Walk in love, even
as Christ loved us, and gave Himself a sacrifice to
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">141</span><span class="ns">] </span>
God for us.&rdquo; If we live as Christ lived, we will,
as He did, give ourselves, for our whole life, to
God, to be used by Him for men. When once
we have done this, given ourselves, no more to seek
anything for ourselves, but for men, and that to
God, for Him to use us, and to impart to us what
we can bestow on others, intercession will become
to us, as it is in Christ in heaven, the great work
of our life. And if ever the thought comes that
the call is too high, or the work too great, the
faith in Christ, the Interceding Christ, who lives
in us, will give us the victory. We will listen to
Him who said, &ldquo;The works that I do, shall ye do; and
greater works shall ye do.&rdquo; We shall remember
that we are not under the law, with its
impotence, but under grace with its omnipotence,
working all in us. We shall believe again in Him
who said to us, Rise and walk, and gave us&mdash;and
we received it&mdash;His life as our strength. We
shall claim afresh the fulness of God&#8217;s Spirit as
His sufficient provision for our need, and count
Him to be in us the Spirit of Intercession, who
makes us one with Christ in His. Oh! let us only
keep our place&mdash;giving up ourselves, like Him, in
Him, to God for men.</p>

<p><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">142</span><span class="ns">] </span>Then we shall understand the part intercession
is to take in God&#8217;s work through us. We shall no
longer try to work for God, and ask Him to follow
it with His blessing. We shall do what the friend
at midnight did, what Christ did on earth, and
ever does in heaven&mdash;we shall first get from God,
and then turn to men to give what He gave us.
As with Christ, we shall make our chief work, we
shall count no time or trouble too great, to receive
from the Father; giving to men will then be in
power.</p>

<p>Servants of Christ! children of God! be of good
courage. Let no fear of feebleness or poverty
make you afraid&mdash;ask in the Name of Christ.
His Name is Himself, in all His perfection and
power. He is the living Christ, and will Himself
make His Name a power in you. Fear not to
plead the Name; His promise is a threefold cord
that cannot be broken: <em>Whatsoever ye ask&mdash;in My
Name</em>&mdash;<span class="allsc">IT SHALL BE DONE UNTO YOU</span>.</p>

<div class="epigraph"><p>&ldquo;Therefore will the Lord wait, that He may be gracious
unto you. Blessed are all they that wait for Him. He will be
very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when He shall
hear it, He will answer thee.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smc">Isa.</span> xxx. 18,&nbsp;19.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord will hear when <em>I call</em> upon Him.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smc">Ps.</span> iv.&nbsp;3.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will look unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my
salvation: my God <em>will hear me</em>.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smc">Mic.</span> vii.&nbsp;7.</p></div>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="start">The</span> power of prayer rests in the faith that God
hears it. In more than one sense this is
true. It is this faith that gives a man courage
to pray. It is this faith that gives him power to
prevail with God. The moment I am assured that
God hears <em>me</em> too, I feel drawn to pray and to
persevere in prayer. I feel strong to claim and to
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">144</span><span class="ns">] </span>
take in faith the answer God gives. One great
reason of lack of prayer is the want of the living,
joyous assurance: &ldquo;My God will hear me.&rdquo; If once
God&#8217;s servants got a vision of the living God
waiting to grant their request, and to bestow all the
heavenly gifts of the Spirit they are in need of, for
themselves or those they are serving, how everything
would be set aside to make time and room
for this one only power that can ensure heavenly
blessing&mdash;the prayer of faith!</p>

<p>When a man can, and does say, in living faith,
&ldquo;My God will hear me!&rdquo; surely nothing can keep
him from prayer. He knows that what he cannot
do or get done on earth, can and will be done for
him from heaven. Let each one of us bow in
stillness before God, and wait on Him to reveal
Himself as the prayer-hearing God. In His
presence the wondrous thoughts gathering round
the central truth will unfold themselves to us.</p>

<p>1. &ldquo;<em>My God will hear me.</em>&rdquo;&mdash;<em>What a blessed certainty!</em>&mdash;We
have God&#8217;s word for it in numberless
promises. We have thousands of witnesses to the
fact that they have found it true. We have had
experience of it in our lives. We have had the
Son of God come from heaven with the message
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">145</span><span class="ns">] </span>
that if we ask, the Father will give. We have
had Himself praying on earth, and being heard.
And we have Him in heaven now, sitting at the
right hand of God and making intercession for us.
God hears prayer&mdash;God delights to hear prayer.
He has allowed His people a thousand times over
to be tried, that they might be compelled to cry
to Him, and learn to know Him as the Hearer
of Prayer.</p>

<p>Let us confess with shame how little we have
believed this wondrous truth, in the sense of receiving
it into our heart, and allowing it to possess and
control our whole being. That we accept a truth
is not enough; the living God, of whom the truth
speaks, must in its light so be revealed, that our
whole life is spent in His presence, with the consciousness
as clear as in a little child towards its
earthly parent&mdash;I know for certain my father
hears me.</p>

<p>Beloved child of God! you know by experience
how little an intellectual apprehension of truth
has profited you. Beseech God to reveal Himself
to you. If you want to live a different prayer-life,
bow each time ere you pray in silence to worship
this God; to wait till there rests on you some right
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">146</span><span class="ns">] </span>
sense of His nearness and readiness to answer. So
will you begin to pray with the words, &ldquo;My God
will hear me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. &ldquo;<em>My God will hear me.</em>&rdquo; <em>What a wondrous
grace!</em>&mdash;Think of God in His infinite majesty, His
altogether incomprehensible glory, His unapproachable
holiness, sitting on a throne of grace, waiting
to be gracious, inviting, encouraging you to pray
with His promise: &ldquo;Call upon Me, and I will answer
thee.&rdquo; Think of yourself, in your nothingness and
helplessness as a creature; in your wretchedness
and transgressions as a sinner; in your feebleness
and unworthiness as a saint; and praise the glory
of that grace which allows you to say boldly of
your prayer for yourself and others, &ldquo;My God will
hear me.&rdquo; Think of how you are not left to yourself,
and what you can accomplish, in this wonderful
intercourse with God. God has united you with
Christ; in Him and His Name you have your
confidence; on the throne He prays with you and
for you; on the footstool of the throne you pray
with Him and in Him. His worth, and the Father&#8217;s
delight in hearing Him, are the measure of your
confidence, your assurance of being heard. There
is more. Think of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">147</span><span class="ns">] </span>
God&#8217;s own Son, sent into your heart to cry, Abba,
Father, and to be <em>in you</em> a Spirit of Supplication,
when you know not what to pray as you ought.
Think, in all your insignificance and unworthiness, of
your being as acceptable as Christ Himself. Think
in all your ignorance and feebleness, of the Spirit
making intercession according to God within you,
and cry out, &ldquo;What wondrous grace! Through
Christ I have access to the Father, by the Spirit.
I can, I do believe it: &lsquo;My God will hear me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>3. &ldquo;<em>My God will hear me.</em>&rdquo;&mdash;<em>What a deep mystery!</em>&mdash;There
are difficulties that cannot but at times
arise and perplex even the honest heart. There is
the question as to God&#8217;s sovereign, all-wise, all-disposing
will. How can our wishes, often so foolish,
and our will, often so selfish, overrule or change
that perfect will? Were it not better to leave all
to His disposal, who knows what is best, and loves
to give us the very best? Or how can our prayer
change what He has ordained before? Then there
is the question as to the need of persevering
prayer, and long waiting for the answer. If God
be Infinite Love, and delighting more to give than
we to receive, where the need for the pleading and
wrestling, the urgency, and the long delay of which
<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">148</span><span class="ns">] </span>
Scripture and experience speak? Arising out of
this there is still another question&mdash;that of the
multitude of apparently vain and unanswered prayers.
How many have pleaded for loved ones, and they
die unsaved. How many cry for years for spiritual
blessing, and no answer comes. To think of all
this tries our faith, and makes us hesitate as we
say, &ldquo;My God will hear me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beloved! prayer, in its power with God, and His
faithfulness to His promise to hear it, is a deep
spiritual mystery. To the questions put above
answers can be given that remove some of the difficulty.
But, after all, the first and the last that
must be said is this: As little as we can comprehend
God can we comprehend this, one of the most
blessed of His attributes, that He hears prayer.
It is a spiritual mystery&mdash;nothing less than the
mystery of the Holy Trinity. God hears because
we pray in His Son, because the Holy Spirit prays
in us. If we have believed and claimed the life of
Christ as our health, and the fulness of the Spirit
as our strength, let us not hesitate to believe in the
power of our prayer too. The Holy Spirit can
enable us to believe and rejoice in it, even where
every question is not yet answered. He will do
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">149</span><span class="ns">] </span>
this, as we lay our questionings in God&#8217;s bosom,
trust His faithfulness, and give ourselves humbly to
obey His command to pray without ceasing. Every
art unfolds its secrets and its beauty only to the man
who practises it. To the humble soul who prays
in the obedience of faith, who practises prayer and
intercession diligently, because God asks it, the
secret of the Lord will be revealed, and the thought
of the deep mystery of prayer, instead of being a
weary problem, will be a source of rejoicing, adoration,
and faith, in which the unceasing refrain is
ever heard: &ldquo;<em>My God will hear me!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>4. &ldquo;<em>My God will hear me.</em>&rdquo; <em>What a solemn responsibility!</em>&mdash;How
often we complain of darkness, of feebleness,
of failure, as if there was no help for it. And God
has promised in answer to our prayer to supply our
every need, and give us His light and strength and
peace. Would that we realised the responsibility
of having such a God, and such promises, with the
sin and shame of not availing ourselves of them to
the utmost. How confident we should feel that the
grace, which we have accepted and trusted to enable
us to pray as we should, will be given.</p>

<p>There is more. This access to a prayer-hearing
God is specially meant to make us intercessors for
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">150</span><span class="ns">] </span>
our fellowmen. Even as Christ obtained His right of
prevailing intercession by His giving Himself a sacrifice
to God for men, and through it receives the blessings
He dispenses, so, if we have truly with Christ
given ourselves to God for men, we share His right of
intercession, and are able to obtain the powers of
the heavenly world for them too. The power of life
and death is in our hands (1&nbsp;John v.&nbsp;16). In
answer to prayer the Spirit can be poured out, souls
can be converted, believers can be established. In
prayer the kingdom of darkness can be conquered,
souls brought out of prison into the liberty of Christ,
and the glory of God be revealed. Through prayer,
the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God,
can be wielded in power, and, in public preaching as
in private speaking, the most rebellious made to bow
at Jesus&#8217; feet.</p>

<p>What a responsibility on the Church to give
herself to the work of intercession! What a
responsibility on every minister, missionary, worker,
set apart for the saving of souls, to yield himself
wholly to act out and prove his faith: &ldquo;My God
will hear me!&rdquo; And what a call on every believer,
instead of burying and losing this talent, to seek to
the very utmost to use it in prayer and supplication
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">151</span><span class="ns">] </span>
for all saints and for all men. My God will hear
me: The deeper our entrance into the truth of
this wondrous power God hath given to men, the
more whole-hearted will be our surrender to the work
of intercession.</p>

<p>5. &ldquo;<em>My God will hear me.</em>&rdquo; <em>What a blessed prospect!</em>&mdash;I
see it&mdash;all the failures of my past life have been
owing to the lack of this faith. My failure, especially
in the work of intercession, has had its deepest
root in this&mdash;I did not live in the full faith of the
blessed assurance, &ldquo;<em>My God will hear me!</em>&rdquo; Praise
God! I begin to see it&mdash;I believe it. All can be
different. Or, rather, I see Him, I believe Him.
&ldquo;<em>My God will hear me!</em>&rdquo; Yes, me, even me! Commonplace
and insignificant though I be, filling but a
very little place, so that I will scarce be missed
when I go&mdash;even I have access to this Infinite God,
with the confidence that He heareth me. One with
Christ, led by the Holy Spirit, I dare to say: &ldquo;I
will pray for others, for I am sure my God will
listen to me: &lsquo;<em>My God will hear me.</em>&rsquo;&rdquo; What a
blessed prospect before me&mdash;every earthly and
spiritual anxiety exchanged for the peace of God,
who cares for all and hears prayer. What a blessed
prospect in my work&mdash;to know that even when the
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">152</span><span class="ns">] </span>
answer is long delayed, and there is a call for much
patient, persevering prayer, the truth remains
infallibly sure&mdash;&ldquo;<em>My God will hear me!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>And what a blessed prospect for Christ&#8217;s Church
if we could but all give prayer its place, give faith
in God its place, or, rather, <em>give the prayer-hearing
God His place</em>! Is not this the one great thing,
those, who in some little measure begin to see the
urgent need of prayer, ought in the first place to
pray for. When God, at the first, time after time,
poured forth the Spirit on His praying people, He
laid down the law for all time: as much of prayer,
so much of the Spirit. Let each one who can say,
&ldquo;<em>My God will hear me</em>,&rdquo; join in the fervent supplication,
that throughout the Church that truth may be
restored to its true place, and the blessed prospect
will be realised: a praying Church endued with
the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>6. &ldquo;<em>My God will hear me.</em>&rdquo; <em>What a need of
Divine teaching!</em>&mdash;We need this, both to enable us
to hold this word in living faith, and to make full
use of it in intercession. It has been said, and it
cannot be said too often or too earnestly, that the
one thing needful for the Church of our day is,
the power of the Holy Spirit. It is just because
<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">153</span><span class="ns">] </span>
this is so, from the Divine side, that we may also
say as truly that, from the human side, the one
thing needful is, more prayer, more believing, persevering
prayer. In speaking of lack of the Spirit&#8217;s
power, and the condition for receiving it, someone
used the expression&mdash;the block is not on the perpendicular,
but on the horizontal line. It is to be
feared that it is on both. There is much to be confessed
and taken away in us if the Spirit is to work
freely. But it is specially on the perpendicular line
that the block is&mdash;the upward look, and the deep
dependence, and the strong crying to God, and the
effectual prayer of faith that avails&mdash;all this is
sadly lacking. And just this is the one thing needful.</p>

<p>Shall we not all set ourselves to learn the
lesson which will make prevailing prayer possible&mdash;the
lesson of a faith that always sings, &ldquo;<em>My God
will hear me</em>&rdquo;? Simple and elementary as it is, it
needs practice and patience, it needs time and
heavenly teaching, to learn it aright. Under the
impression of a bright thought, or a blessed experience,
it may look as if we knew the lesson
perfectly. But ever again the need will recur of
making this our first prayer&mdash;that God who hears
prayer would teach us to believe it, and so to pray
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">154</span><span class="ns">] </span>
aright. If we desire it we can count upon Him
He who delights in hearing prayer and answering it,
He who gave His Son that He might ever pray
for us and with us, and His Holy Spirit to pray
in us, we can be sure there is not a prayer that
He will hear more certainly than this: that He
so reveal Himself as the prayer-hearing God, that
our whole being may respond, &ldquo;<em>My God will hear
me.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="start">God</span> took His own Son, and made Him our Example
and our Pattern. It sometimes is as if the
power of Christ&#8217;s example is lost in the thought that
He, in whom is no sin, is not man as we are. Our
Lord took Paul, a man of like passions with ourselves,
and made him a pattern of what he could do for
one who was the chief of sinners. And Paul, the
man who, more than any other, has set his mark
on the Church, has ever been appealed to as a
pattern man. In his mastery of Divine truth, and
<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">156</span><span class="ns">] </span>
his teaching of it; in his devotion to his Lord, and
his self-consuming zeal in His service; in his deep
experience of the power of the indwelling Christ and
the fellowship of his cross; in the sincerity of his
humility, and the simplicity and boldness of his faith;
in his missionary enthusiasm and endurance&mdash;in all
this, and so much more, &ldquo;the grace of our Lord
Jesus was exceeding abundant in him.&rdquo; Christ
gave him, and the Church has accepted him, as a
pattern of what Christ would have, of what Christ
would work. Seven times Paul speaks of believers
following him: (1&nbsp;Cor. iv.&nbsp;16), &ldquo;Wherefore I beseech
you, be ye followers of me&rdquo;; (xi.&nbsp;1), &ldquo;Be ye followers
of me, even as I am of Christ&rdquo;; Phil, iii.&nbsp;17,
iv.&nbsp;9; 1&nbsp;Thess. i.&nbsp;6; 2&nbsp;Thess. iii. 7&ndash;9.</p>

<p>If Paul, as a pattern of prayer, is not as much
studied or appealed to as he is in other respects, it
is not because he is not in this too as remarkable
a proof of what grace can do, or because we do
not, in this respect, as much stand in need of the
help of his example. A study of Paul as a pattern
of prayer will bring a rich reward of instruction
and encouragement. The words our Lord used of
him at his conversion, &ldquo;Behold he prayeth,&rdquo; may be
taken as the keynote of his life. The heavenly
<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">157</span><span class="ns">] </span>
vision which brought him to his knees ever after
ruled his life. Christ at the right hand of God, in
whom we are blessed with all spiritual blessings,
was everything to him; to pray and expect the
heavenly power in his work and on his work, from
heaven direct by prayer, was the simple outcome of
his faith in the Glorified One. In this, too, Christ
meant him to be a pattern, that we might learn
that, just in the measure in which the heavenliness
of Christ and His gifts, the unworldliness of the
powers that work for salvation, are known and
believed, will prayer become the spontaneous rising
of the heart to the only source of its life. Let us
see what we know of Paul.</p>

<h4 class="smc">Paul&#8217;s Habits of Prayer.</h4>

<p>These are revealed almost unconsciously. He
writes (Rom. i.&nbsp;9), &ldquo;God is my witness, that without
ceasing I make mention of you <em>always in my
prayers</em>. For I long to see you, that I may impart
unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be
established.&rdquo; Rom. x.&nbsp;1, ix. 2,&nbsp;3: &ldquo;My <em>heart&#8217;s
desire and prayer to God</em> for Israel is, that they
may be saved&rdquo;; &ldquo;I have great heaviness and
<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">158</span><span class="ns">] </span>
<em>continual sorrow of heart</em>; for I could wish that myself
were accursed from Christ for my brethren.&rdquo;
1&nbsp;Cor. i.&nbsp;4: &ldquo;I thank my God <em>always</em> on your
behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by
Jesus Christ.&rdquo; 2&nbsp;Cor. vi. 4,&nbsp;6: &ldquo;Approving ourselves
as the ministers of Christ, <em>in watchings</em>, <em>in
fastings</em>.&rdquo; Gal. iv.&nbsp;19: &ldquo;My little children, of
whom <em>I travail in birth again</em> till Christ be formed
in you.&rdquo; Eph. i.&nbsp;16: &ldquo;<em>I cease not</em> to give thanks
for you, making mention of you <em>in my prayers</em>.&rdquo;
Eph. iii.&nbsp;14: &ldquo;<em>I bow my knees</em> to the Father, that He
would grant you to be strengthened with might by
His Spirit in the inner man.&rdquo; Phil. i. 3, 4, 8,&nbsp;9: &ldquo;I
thank my God <em>upon every remembrance of you,
always in every prayer of mine</em> making request for
you all with joy. For God is my record, how
greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus
Christ. And this <em>I pray</em>&rdquo;&mdash;Col. i. 3,&nbsp;9: &ldquo;We
give thanks to God, <em>praying always for you</em>. For
this cause also, since the day we heard it, we <em>do not
cease to pray for you</em>, and to desire&rdquo;&mdash;Col. ii.&nbsp;1:
&ldquo;I would that ye knew what <em>great conflict</em> I have
for you, and for as many as have not seen my face
in the flesh.&rdquo; 1&nbsp;Thess. i.&nbsp;2: &ldquo;We give thanks to
God <em>always</em> for you all, making mention of you <em>in
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">159</span><span class="ns">] </span>
our prayers</em>.&rdquo; iii.&nbsp;9: &ldquo;We joy for your sakes
before God; <em>night and day praying exceedingly</em> that
we might perfect that which is lacking in your
faith.&rdquo; 2&nbsp;Thess. i.&nbsp;3: &ldquo;We are bound to thank
God <em>always</em> for you. Wherefore also <em>we always
pray</em> for you.&rdquo; 2&nbsp;Tim. i.&nbsp;3: &ldquo;I thank God, that
<em>without ceasing</em> I have remembrance of thee night
and day.&rdquo; Philem.&nbsp;4: &ldquo;I thank my God, making
mention of thee <em>always in my prayers</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These passages taken together give us the picture
of a man whose words, &ldquo;Pray without ceasing,&rdquo;
were simply the expression of his daily life. He
had such a sense of the insufficiency of simple conversion;
of the need of the grace and the power of
heaven being brought down for the young converts
in prayer; of the need of much and unceasing
prayer, day and night, to bring it down; of the
certainty that prayer would bring it down&mdash;that
his life was continual and most definite prayer.
He had such a sense that everything must come
from above, and such a faith that it would come
in answer to prayer, that prayer was neither a duty
nor a burden, but the natural turning of the heart to
the only place whence it could possibly obtain what
it sought for others.</p>

The Contents of Paul&#8217;s Prayers.</h4>

<p>It is of as much importance to know <em>what</em> Paul
prayed, as how frequently and earnestly he did so.
Intercession is a spiritual work. Our confidence
in it will depend much on our knowing that we ask
according to the will of God. The more distinctly
we ask heavenly things, which we feel at once God
alone can bestow, which we are sure He will bestow,
the more direct and urgent will our appeal be to
God alone. The more impossible the things are
that we seek, the more we will turn from all human
work to prayer and to God alone.</p>

<p>In the Epistles, in addition to expressions in
which he speaks of his praying, we have a number
of distinct prayers in which Paul gives utterance to
his heart&#8217;s desire for those to whom he writes. In
these we see that his first desire was always that
they might be &ldquo;established&rdquo; in the Christian life.
Much as he praised God when he heard of conversion,
he knew how feeble the young converts
were, and how for their establishing nothing
would avail without the grace of the Spirit prayed
down. If we notice some of the principal of
<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">161</span><span class="ns">] </span>
these prayers we shall see what he asked and
obtained.</p>

<p>Take the two prayers in Ephesians&mdash;the one for
light, the other for strength. In the former (i.&nbsp;15),
he prays for the Spirit of wisdom to enlighten
them to know what their calling was, what their inheritance,
what the mighty power of God working
in them. Spiritual enlightenment and knowledge
was their great need, to be obtained for them by
prayer. In the latter (iii.&nbsp;15) he asks that the
power they had been led to see in Christ might
work in them, and they be strengthened with
Divine might, so as to have the indwelling Christ,
and the love that passeth knowledge, and the fulness
of God actually come on them. These were
things that could only come direct from heaven;
these were things he asked and expected. If
we want to learn Paul&#8217;s art of intercession,
we must ask nothing less for believers in our
days.</p>

<p>Look at the prayer in Philippians (i. 9&ndash;11).
There, too, it is first for spiritual knowledge; then
comes a blameless life, and then a fruitful life to
the glory of God. So also in the beautiful prayer
in Colossians (i. 9&ndash;11). First, spiritual knowledge<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">162</span><span class="ns">] </span>
and understanding of God&#8217;s will, then the strengthening
with all might to all patience and joy.</p>

<p>Or take the two prayers in 1&nbsp;Thessalonians (iii.
12, 13, and v.&nbsp;23). The one: &ldquo;God so increase
your love to one another, that He may stablish
your <em>hearts unblameable in holiness</em>.&rdquo; The other:
&ldquo;God <em>sanctify you wholly</em>, and preserve you blameless.&rdquo;
The very words are so high that we hardly
understand, still less believe, still less experience
what they mean. Paul so lived in the heavenly
world, he was so at home in the holiness and
omnipotence of God and His love, that such prayers
were the natural expression of what he knew God
could and would do. &ldquo;God stablish your hearts
unblameable in holiness,&rdquo; &ldquo;God sanctify you wholly&rdquo;&mdash;the
man who believes in these things and desires
them, will pray for them for others. The prayers
are all a proof that he seeks for them the very life
of heaven upon earth. No wonder that he is not
tempted to trust in any human means, but looks for
it from heaven alone. Again, I say, the more we take
Paul&#8217;s prayers as our pattern, and make his desires
our own for believers for whom we pray, the more
will prayer to the God of heaven become as our
daily breath.</p>

Paul&#8217;s Requests for Prayer.</h4>

<p>These are no less instructive than his own
prayers for the saints. They prove that he does
not count prayer any special prerogative of an
apostle; he calls the humblest and simplest
believer to claim his right. They prove that he
does not think that only the new converts or
feeble Christians need prayer; he himself is, as a
member of the body, dependent upon his brethren
and their prayers. After he had preached the
gospel for twenty years, he still asks for prayer
that he may speak as he ought to speak. Not
once for all, not for a time, but day by day, and
that without ceasing, must grace be sought and
brought down from heaven for his work. United,
continued waiting on God is to Paul the only hope
of the Church. With the Holy Spirit a heavenly
life, the life of the Lord in heaven, entered the
world; nothing but unbroken communication with
heaven can keep it up.</p>

<p>Listen how he asks for prayer, and with what
earnestness&mdash;Rom. xv.&nbsp;30: &ldquo;<em>I beseech you</em>, brethren,
for the Lord Jesus Christ&#8217;s sake, and for the love
<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">164</span><span class="ns">] </span>
of the Spirit, that ye <em>strive together with me in your
prayers</em> to God for me; that I may be delivered
from them which do not believe in Judæa; and
may come unto you with joy by the will of God.&rdquo;
How remarkably both prayers were answered:
Rom. xv.&nbsp;5, 6,&nbsp;13. The remarkable fact that the
Roman world-power, which in Pilate with Christ,
in Herod with Peter, at Philippi, had proved its
antagonism to God&#8217;s kingdom, all at once becomes
Paul&#8217;s protector, and secures him a safe convoy to
Rome, can only be accounted for by these prayers.</p>

<p>2&nbsp;Cor. i. 10,&nbsp;11: &ldquo;In whom we trust that He
will yet deliver us, <em>ye also helping together by prayer</em>
for us.&rdquo; Eph. vi. 18,&nbsp;19: &ldquo;Praying always with all
prayer and supplication in the Spirit, for all saints;
<em>and for me</em> that I may open my mouth boldly,
that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to
speak.&rdquo; Phil. i.&nbsp;19: &ldquo;I know that this (trouble)
shall turn to my salvation, <em>through your prayer</em>,
and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;
Col. iv.&nbsp;2, 3,&nbsp;4: &ldquo;Continue in prayer; withal also
<em>praying for us</em>, that God would open unto us a door
of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ: that
I may make it manifest as I ought to speak.&rdquo;
1&nbsp;Thess. v.&nbsp;25: &ldquo;Brethren, pray for us.&rdquo; Philem.&nbsp;22:
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">165</span><span class="ns">] </span>
&ldquo;I trust that through your prayers I shall be given
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We saw how Christ prayed, and taught His
disciples to pray. We see how Paul prayed, and
taught the churches to pray. As the Master, so
the servant calls us to believe and to prove that
prayer is the power alike of the ministry and the
Church. Of his faith we have a summary in these
remarkable words concerning something that caused
him grief: &ldquo;This shall turn to my salvation through
your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus
Christ.&rdquo; As much as he looked to his Lord
in heaven did he look to his brethren on
earth, to secure the supply of that Spirit
for him. The Spirit from heaven and prayer
on earth were to him, as to the twelve
after Pentecost, inseparably linked. We speak
often of apostolic zeal and devotion and power&mdash;may
God give us a revival of apostolic
prayer.</p>

<p>Let me once again ask the question: Does the
work of intercession take the place in the Church
it ought to have? Is it a thing commonly understood
in the Lord&#8217;s work, that everything depends
upon getting from God that &ldquo;supply of the Spirit
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">166</span><span class="ns">] </span>
of Christ&rdquo; for and in ourselves that can give our
work its real power to bless. This is Christ&#8217;s
Divine order for all work, His own and that of His
servants; this is the order Paul followed: first
come every day, as having nothing, and receive
from God &ldquo;the supply of the Spirit&rdquo; in intercession&mdash;then
go and impart what has come to thee
from heaven.</p>

<p>In all His instructions, our Lord Jesus spake
much oftener to His disciples about their praying
than their preaching. In the farewell discourse,
He said little about preaching, but much about the
Holy Spirit, and their asking whatsoever they
would in His Name. If we are to return to this
life of the first apostles and of Paul, and really
accept the truth every day&mdash;my first work, my
only strength is intercession, to secure the power
of God on the souls entrusted to me&mdash;we must have
the courage to confess past sin, and to believe that
there is deliverance. To break through old habits,
to resist the clamour of pressing duties that have
always had their way, to make every other call
subordinate to this one, whether others approve
or not, will not be easy at first. But the
men or women who are faithful will not only
<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">167</span><span class="ns">] </span>
have a reward themselves, but become benefactors
to their brethren. &ldquo;Thou shalt be called the
repairer of the breach, the restorer of paths to
dwell in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But is it really possible? Can it indeed be that
those who have never been able to face, much less
to overcome the difficulty, can yet become mighty
in prayer? Tell me, was it really possible for
Jacob to become Israel&mdash;a prince who prevailed
with God? It was. The things that are impossible
with men are possible with God. Have
you not in very deed received from the Father, as
the great fruit of Christ&#8217;s redemption, the Spirit
of supplication, the Spirit of intercession? Just
pause and think what that means. And will you
still doubt whether God is able to make you
&ldquo;strivers with God,&rdquo; princes who prevail with Him?
Oh, let us banish all fear, and in faith claim the
grace for which we have the Holy Spirit dwelling
in us, the grace of supplication, the grace of intercession.
Let us quietly, perseveringly believe that
He lives in us, and will enable us to do our work.
Let us in faith not fear to accept and yield to the
great truth that intercession, as it is the great
work of the King on the throne, <em>is the great work of
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">168</span><span class="ns">] </span>
His servants on earth</em>. We have the Holy Spirit,
who brings the Christ-life into our hearts, to fit us
for this work. Let us at once begin and stir up
the gift within us. As we set aside each day our
time for intercession, and count upon the Spirit&#8217;s
enabling power, the confidence will grow that we
can, in our measure, follow Paul even as he followed
Christ.</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="start">In</span> the study of the starry heavens, how much
depends upon a due apprehension of magnitudes.
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">170</span><span class="ns">] </span>
Without some sense of the size of the heavenly
bodies, that appear so small to the eye, and yet
are so great, and of the almost illimitable extent
of the regions in which they move, though they
appear so near and so familiar, there can be no
true knowledge of the heavenly world or its relation
to this earth. It is even so with the spiritual
heavens, and the heavenly life in which we are
called to live. It is specially so in the life of
intercession, that most wondrous intercourse between
heaven and earth. Everything depends
upon the due apprehension of magnitudes.</p>

<p>Just think of the three that come first: There
is a world, with its needs entirely dependent on and
waiting to be helped by intercession; there is a
God in heaven, with His all-sufficient supply for all
those needs, waiting to be asked; there is a Church,
with its wondrous calling and its sure promises,
waiting to be roused to a sense of its wondrous
responsibility and power.</p>

<p><em>God seeks intercessors.</em>&mdash;There is a world with
its perishing millions, with intercession as its only
hope. How much of love and work is comparatively
vain, because there is so little intercession.
A thousand millions living as if there never had
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">171</span><span class="ns">] </span>
been a Son of God to die for them. Thirty millions
every year passing into the outer darkness without
hope. Fifty millions bearing the Christian name,
and the great majority living in utter ignorance or
indifference. Millions of feeble, sickly Christians;
thousands of wearied workers, who could be blessed
by intercession, could help themselves to become
mighty in intercession. Churches and missions
sacrificing life and labour often with little result,
for lack of intercession. Souls, each one worth
more than worlds, worth nothing less than the
price paid for them in Christ&#8217;s blood, and within
reach of the power that can be won by intercession.
We surely have no conception of the magnitude of
the work to be done by God&#8217;s intercessors, or we
should cry to God above everything to give from
heaven the spirit of intercession.</p>

<p><em>God seeks intercessors.</em>&mdash;There is a God of glory
able to meet all these needs. We are told that He
delights in mercy, that He waits to be gracious,
that He longs to pour out His blessing; that the
love that gave the Son to death is the measure of
the love that each moment hovers over every human
being. And yet He does not help. And there they
perish, a million a month in China alone, and it
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">172</span><span class="ns">] </span>
is as if God does not move. If He does so love
and long to bless, there must be some inscrutable
reason for His holding back. What can it be?
Scripture says, because of your unbelief. It is the
faithlessness and consequent unfaithfulness of God&#8217;s
people. He has taken them up into partnership
with Himself; He has honoured them, and bound
Himself, by making their prayers one of the standard
measures of the working of His power. Lack of
intercession is one of the chief causes of lack of
blessing. Oh, that we would turn eye and heart
from everything else and fix them upon this God
who hears prayer, until the magnificence of His
promises, and His power, and His purpose of love
overwhelmed us! How our whole life and heart
would become intercession.</p>

<p><em>God seeks intercessors.</em>&mdash;There is a third magnitude
to which our eyes must be opened: the wondrous
privilege and power of the intercessors. There is
a false humility, which makes a great virtue of
self-depreciation, because it has never seen its
utter nothingness. If it knew that, it would never
apologise for its feebleness, but glory in its utter
weakness, as the one condition of Christ&#8217;s power
resting on it. It would judge of itself, its power
<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">173</span><span class="ns">] </span>
and influence before God in prayer, as little by
what it sees or feels, as we judge of the size of the
sun or stars by what the eye can see. Faith sees
man created in God&#8217;s image and likeness to be
God&#8217;s representative in this world and have dominion
over it. Faith sees man redeemed and lifted into
union with Christ, abiding in Him, identified with
Him, and clothed with His power in intercession.
Faith sees the Holy Spirit dwelling and praying
in the heart, making, in our sighings, intercession
according to God. Faith sees the intercession of
the saints to be part of the life of the Holy Trinity&mdash;the
believer as God&#8217;s child asking of the Father,
in the Son, through the Spirit. Faith sees something
of the Divine fitness and beauty of this scheme
of salvation through intercession, wakens the soul
to a consciousness of its wondrous destiny, and
girds it with strength for the blessed self-sacrifice
it calls to.</p>

<p><em>God seeks intercessors.</em>&mdash;When He called His
people out of Egypt, He separated the priestly
tribe, to draw nigh to Him, and stand before Him,
and bless the people in His name. From time to
time He sought and found and honoured intercessors,
for whose sake He spared or blessed His
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">174</span><span class="ns">] </span>
people. When our Lord left the earth He said to
the inner circle He had gathered around Him&mdash;an
inner circle of special devotion to His service, to
which access is still free to every disciple: &ldquo;I
chose you, and appointed you, that whatsoever ye
shall ask of the Father in My Name, He may give
it you.&rdquo; We have already noticed the six times
repeated three wonderful words&mdash;<em>Whatsoever</em>&mdash;<em>In
My Name</em>&mdash;<em>It shall be done</em>. In them Christ placed
the powers of the heavenly world at their disposal&mdash;not
for their own selfish use, but in the interests
of His kingdom. How wondrously they used it we
know. And since that time, down through the ages,
these men have had their successors, men who have
proved how surely God works in answer to prayer.
And we may praise God that, in our days too, there
is an ever-increasing number who begin to see and
prove that in church and mission, in large societies
and little circles and individual effort, intercession
is the chief thing, the power that moves God and
opens heaven. They are learning, and long to learn
better, and that all may learn, that in all work for
souls intercession must take the first place, and that
those who in it have received from heaven, in the
power of the Holy Ghost, what they are to
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">175</span><span class="ns">] </span>
communicate to others, will be best able to do the
Lord&#8217;s work.</p>

<p><em>God seeks intercessors.</em>&mdash;Though God had His
appointed servants in Israel, watchmen set by
Himself to cry to Him day and night and give
Him no rest, He often had to wonder and complain
that there was no intercessor, none to stir
himself up to take hold of His strength. And He
still waits and wonders in our day, that there are
not more intercessors, that all His children do not
give themselves to this highest and holiest work,
that many of them who do so, do not engage in it
more intensely and perseveringly. He wonders to
find ministers of His gospel complaining that their
duties do not allow them to find time for this,
which He counts their first, their highest, their most
delightful, their alone effective work. He wonders
to find His sons and daughters, who have forsaken
home and friends for His sake and the gospel&#8217;s,
come so short in what He meant to be their abiding
strength&mdash;receiving day by day all they needed to
impart to the dark heathen. He wonders to find
multitudes of His children who have hardly any
conception of what intercession is. He wonders to
find multitudes more who have learned that it
<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">176</span><span class="ns">] </span>
is their duty, and seek to obey it, but confess that
they know but little of taking hold upon God or
prevailing with Him.</p>

<p><em>God seeks intercessors.</em>&mdash;He longs to dispense larger
blessings. He longs to reveal His power and
glory as God, His saving love, more abundantly.
He seeks intercessors in larger number, in greater
power, to prepare the way of the Lord. He seeks
them. Where could He seek them but in His
Church? And how does He expect to find them?
He intrusted to His Church the task of telling of
their Lord&#8217;s need, the task of encouraging and
training, and preparing them for His holy service.
And He ever comes again, seeking fruit, seeking
intercessors. In His Word He has spoken of the
&ldquo;widows indeed, who trust in God, and continue
in supplication night and day.&rdquo; He looks if the
Church is training the great army of aged men and
women, whose time of outward work is past, but
who can strengthen the army of the &ldquo;elect, who
cry to Him day and night.&rdquo; He looks to the great
host of the Christian Endeavour, the three or four
million of young lives that have given themselves
away in the solemn pledge, &ldquo;I promise the Lord
Jesus Christ that I will strive to do whatever He
<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">177</span><span class="ns">] </span>
would like to have me do,&rdquo; and wonders how many
are being trained to pass from the brightness of
the weekly prayer-meeting and its confession of
loyalty, to swell the secret intercession that is
to save souls. He looks to the thousands of young
men and young women in training for the work of
ministry and mission, and gazes longingly to see if
the Church is teaching them that intercession,
power with God, must be their first care, and in
seeking to train and help them to it. He looks to
see whether ministers and missionaries are understanding
their opportunity, and labouring to train
the believers of their congregation into those who
can &ldquo;help together&rdquo; by their prayer, and can
&ldquo;strive with them in their prayers.&rdquo; As Christ
seeks the lost sheep until He find it, Gods seeks
intercessors. (<a name="nta.F" id="nta.F" href="#nt.F">Note F.</a>)</p>

<p><em>God seeks intercessors.</em>&mdash;He will not, He cannot,
take the work out of the hands of His Church.
And so He comes, calling and pleading in many
ways. Now by a man whom He raises up to live
a life of faith in His service, and to prove how
actually and abundantly He answers prayer. Then
by the story of a church which makes prayer
for souls its starting-point, and bears testimony to
<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">178</span><span class="ns">] </span>
God&#8217;s faithfulness. Sometimes in a mission which
proves how special prayer can meet special need,
and bring down the power of the Spirit. And
sometimes again by a season of revival coming in
answer to united urgent supplication. In these
and many other ways God is showing us what
intercession can do, and beseeching us to waken up
and train His great host to be, every one, a people
of intercessors.</p>

<p><em>God seeks intercessors.</em>&mdash;He sends His servants
out to call them. Let ministers make this a part
of their duty. Let them make their church a training
school of intercession. Give the people definite
objects for prayer. Encourage them to take
a definite time to it, if it were only ten minutes
every day. Help them to understand the boldness
they may use with God. Teach them to expect
and look out for answers. Show them what it
is first to pray and get an answer in secret, and
then carry the answer and impart the blessing.
Tell everyone who is master of his own time that
he is as the angels, free to tarry before the
throne and then go out and minister to the heirs
of salvation. Sound out the blessed tidings that
this honour is for all God&#8217;s people. There is no
<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">179</span><span class="ns">] </span>
difference. That servant girl, this day labourer,
that bedridden invalid, this daughter in her
mother&#8217;s home, these men and young men in
business&mdash;all are called, all, all are needed. God
seeks intercessors.</p>

<p><em>God seeks intercessors.</em>&mdash;As ministers take up the
work of finding and training them it will urge
themselves to pray more. Christ gave Paul to
be a pattern of His grace before He made him
a preacher of it. It has been well said, &ldquo;The
first duty of a clergyman is humbly to beg of
God that all he would have done in his people may
be first truly and fully done in himself.&rdquo; The effort
to bring this message of God may cause much
heart-searching and humiliation. All the better.
The best practice in doing a thing is helping others
to do it. O ye servants of Christ, set as watchmen
to cry to God day and night, let us awake to our
holy calling. Let us believe in the power of
intercession. Let us practise it. Let us seek on
behalf of our people to get from God Himself the
Spirit and the Life we preach. With our spirit
and life given up to God in intercession, the Spirit
and Life that God gives them through us cannot
fail to be the Life of Intercession too.</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="start"><em>The Coming Revival</em></span>&mdash;one frequently hears
the word. There are teachers not a few who
see the tokens of its approach, and confidently herald
its speedy appearance. In the increase of mission
interest, in the tidings of revivals in places where
all were dead or cold, in the hosts of our young
<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">181</span><span class="ns">] </span>
gathered into Students&#8217; and other Associations or
Christian Endeavour Societies, in doors everywhere
opened in the Christian and the heathen world, in
victories already secured in the fields white unto
the harvest, wherever believing, hopeful workers
enter, they find the assurance of a time of power
and blessing such as we have not known. The
Church is about to enter on a new era of increasing
spirituality and larger extension.</p>

<p>There are others who, while admitting the truth
of some of these facts, yet fear that the conclusions
drawn from them are one-sided and premature.
They see the interest in missions increased, but
point out to how small a circle it is confined, and
how utterly out of proportion it is to what it ought
to be. To the great majority of Church members,
to the greater part of the Church, it is as yet
anything but a life question. They remind us of
the power of worldliness and formality, of the
increase of the money-making and pleasure-loving
spirit among professing Christians, to the lack of
spirituality in so many, many of our churches,
and the continuing and apparently increasing
estrangement of multitudes from God&#8217;s Day and
Word, as proof that the great revival has certainly
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">182</span><span class="ns">] </span>
not begun, and is hardly thought of by the most.
They say that they do not see the deep
humiliation, the intense desire, the fervent prayer
which appear as the forerunners of every true
revival.</p>

<p>There are right-hand and left-hand errors which
are equally dangerous. We must seek as much to
be kept from the superficial Optimism, which never
is able to gauge the extent of the evil, as from
the hopeless Pessimism which can neither praise
God for what He has done, nor trust Him for what
He is ready to do. The former will lose itself in a
happy self-gratulation, as it rejoices in its zeal and
diligence and apparent success, and never see the
need of confession and great striving in prayer, ere
we are prepared to meet and conquer the hosts of
darkness. The latter virtually gives over the
world to Satan, and almost prays and rejoices to
see things get worse, to hasten the coming of Him
who is to put all right. May God keep us from
either error, and fulfil the promise, &ldquo;Thine ears
shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the
way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand,
and when ye turn to the left.&rdquo; Let us listen to
the lessons suggested by the passages we have
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">183</span><span class="ns">] </span>
quoted; they may help us to pray the prayer
aright: &ldquo;Revive Thy work, O Lord!&rdquo;</p>

<p>1. &ldquo;<em>Revive Thy work, O Lord!</em>&rdquo;&mdash;Read again the
passages of Scripture, and see how they all contain
the one thought: Revival is God&#8217;s work; He alone
can give it; it must come from above. We are frequently
in danger of looking to what God has done
and is doing, and to count on that as the pledge
that He will at once do more. And all the time
it may be true that He is blessing us up to the
measure of our faith or self-sacrifice, and cannot
give larger measure, until there has been a new
discovery and confession of what is hindering Him.
Or we may be looking to all the signs of life and
good around us, and congratulating ourselves on all
the organisations and agencies that are being
created, while the need of God&#8217;s mighty and direct
interposition is not rightly felt, and the entire
dependence upon Him not cultivated. Regeneration,
the giving of Divine life, we all acknowledge
to be God&#8217;s act, a miracle of His power. The
restoring or reviving of the Divine life, in a soul
or a Church, is as much a supernatural work. To
have the spiritual discernment that can understand
the signs of the heavens, and prognosticate the
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">184</span><span class="ns">] </span>
coming revival, we need to enter deep into God&#8217;s
mind and will as to its conditions, and the preparedness
of those who pray for it or are to be used to
bring it about. &ldquo;Surely the Lord God will do
nothing, but He revealeth His secret unto his
servants the prophets.&rdquo; It is God who is to give
the revival; it is God who reveals His secret; it is
the spirit of absolute dependence upon God, giving
Him the honour and the glory, that will prepare
for it.</p>

<p>2. &ldquo;<em>Revive Thy work, O Lord!</em>&rdquo;&mdash;A second
lesson suggested is, that the revival God is to give
will be given in answer to prayer. It must be
asked and received direct from God Himself.
Those who know anything of the history of revivals
will remember how often this has been proved&mdash;both
larger and more local revivals have been
distinctly traced to special prayer. In our own
day there are numbers of congregations and missions
where special or permanent revivals are&mdash;all glory
be to God&mdash;connected with systematic, believing
prayer. The coming revival will be no exception.
An extraordinary spirit of prayer, urging believers
to much secret and united prayer, pressing them to
&ldquo;labour fervently&rdquo; in their supplications, will be
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">185</span><span class="ns">] </span>
one of the surest signs of approaching showers and
floods of blessing.</p>

<p>Let all who are burdened with the lack of
spirituality, with the low state of the life of God in
believers, listen to the call that comes to all. If
there is to be revival,&mdash;a mighty, Divine revival,&mdash;it
will need, on our part, corresponding whole-heartedness
in prayer and faith. Let not one believer
think himself too weak to help, or imagine that he
will not be missed. If he first begin, the gift that
is in him may be so stirred that, for his circle or
neighbourhood, he shall be God&#8217;s chosen intercessor.
Let us think of the need of souls, of all the sins and
failings among God&#8217;s people, of the little power
there is in so much of the preaching, and begin to
cry every day, &ldquo;Wilt Thou not revive us again, that
Thy people may rejoice in Thee?&rdquo; And let us have
the truth graven deep in our hearts: every revival
comes, as Pentecost came, as the fruit of united,
continued prayer. The coming revival must begin
with a great prayer revival. It is in the closet,
with the door shut, that the sound of abundance
of rain will be first heard. An increase of secret
prayer with ministers and members, will be the
sure harbinger of blessing.</p>

<p><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">186</span><span class="ns">] </span>
3. &ldquo;<em>Revive Thy work, O Lord!</em>&rdquo;&mdash;A third lesson
our texts teach is that it is to the humble and
contrite that the revival is promised. We want
the revival to come upon the proud and the self-satisfied,
to break them down and save them. God
will give this, but only on the condition that
those who see and feel the sin of others take their
burden of confession and bear it, and that all
who pray for and claim in faith God&#8217;s reviving
power for His Church, shall humble themselves
with the confession of its sins. The need of revival
always points to previous decline; and decline was
always caused by sin. Humiliation and contrition
have ever been the conditions of revival.
In all intercession confession of man&#8217;s sin and God&#8217;s
righteous judgment is ever an essential element.</p>

<p>Throughout the history of Israel we continually
see this. It comes out in the reformations under
the pious Kings of Judah. We hear it in the prayer
of men like Ezra and Nehemiah and Daniel. In
Isaiah and Jeremiah and Ezekiel, as well as in
the minor prophets, it is the keynote of all the
warning as of all the promise. If there be no
humiliation and forsaking of sin there can be no
revival or deliverance: &ldquo;These men have set up
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">187</span><span class="ns">] </span>
their idols in their hearts. Shall I at all be
inquired of by them?&rdquo; &ldquo;To this man will I
look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite
spirit, and that trembleth at My word.&rdquo; Amid
the most gracious promises of Divine visitation there
is ever this note: &ldquo;Be ashamed and confounded for
your ways, O House of Israel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We find the same in the New Testament. The
Sermon on the Mount promises the kingdom to the
poor and them that mourn. In the Epistles to the
Corinthians and Galatians the religion of man, of
worldly wisdom and confidence in the flesh, is
exposed and denounced; without its being confessed
and forsaken, all the promises of grace and the
Spirit will be vain. In the Epistles to the seven
churches we find five of which He, out of whose
mouth goes the sharp, two-edged sword, says, that
He has something against them. In each of these
the keyword of His message is&mdash;not to the unconverted,
but to the Church&mdash;Repent! All the
glorious promises which each of these Epistles contain,
down to the last one, with its &ldquo;Open the door
and I will come in&rdquo;; &ldquo;He that overcometh shall sit
with Me on My throne,&rdquo; are dependent on that one
word&mdash;Repent!</p>

<p><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">188</span><span class="ns">] </span>
And if there is to be a revival, not among the
unsaved, but in our churches, to give a holy,
spiritual membership, will not that trumpet sound
need to be heard&mdash;Repent? Was it only in Israel,
in the ministry of kings and prophets, that there
was so much evil in God&#8217;s people to be cleansed
away? Was it only in the Church of the first
century, that Paul and James and our Lord Himself
had to speak such sharp words? Or is there
not in the Church of our days an idolatry of money
and talent and culture, a worldly spirit, making it
unfaithful to its one only Husband and Lord, a confidence
in the flesh which grieves and resists God&#8217;s
Holy Spirit? Is there not almost everywhere a
confession of the lack of spirituality and spiritual
power? Let all who long for the coming revival,
and seek to hasten it by their prayers, pray this
above everything, that the Lord may prepare His
prophets to go before Him at His bidding: &ldquo;Cry
aloud and spare not, lift up thy voice like a
trumpet, and show My people their transgression.&rdquo;
Every deep revival among God&#8217;s people must have
its roots in a deep sense and confession of sin.
Until those who would lead the Church in the path
of revival bear faithful testimony against the sins
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">189</span><span class="ns">] </span>
of the Church, it is to feared that it will find people
unprepared. Men would fain have a revival as the
outgrowth of their agencies and progress. God&#8217;s
way is the opposite: it is out of death, acknowledged
as the desert of sin, confessed as utter helplessness,
that He revives. He revives the heart of the
contrite one.</p>

<p>4. &ldquo;<em>Revive Thy work, O Lord!</em>&rdquo;&mdash;There is a last
thought, suggested by the text from Hosea. It is
as we return to <em>the Lord</em> that revival will come;
for if we had not wandered from Him, His life
would be among us in power. &ldquo;Come and let
us return to the Lord: for He hath torn, He will
heal us: He hath smitten; He will bind us up:
<em>He will revive us</em>, and we shall live in His sight.&rdquo;
As we have said, there can be no return to the
Lord, where there is no sense or confession of
wandering. <em>Let us return to the Lord</em> must be the
keynote of the revival. Let us return, acknowledging
and forsaking whatever there has been in
the Church that is not entirely according to His
mind and spirit. Let us return, yielding up and
casting out whatever there has been in our religion
or along with it of the power of God&#8217;s two great
enemies&mdash;confidence in the flesh or the spirit of
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">190</span><span class="ns">] </span>
the world. Let us return, in the acknowledgment
of how undividedly God must have us, to fill us
with His Spirit, and use us for the kingdom of His
Son. Oh, let us return, in the surrender of a
dependence and a devotion which has no measure
but the absolute claim of Him who is the Lord!
Let us return to the Lord with our whole heart,
that He may make and keep us wholly His. He
will revive us, and we shall live in His sight. Let
us turn to the God of Pentecost, as Christ led his
disciples to turn to Him, and the God of Pentecost
will turn to us.</p>

<p>It is for this returning to the Lord that the
great work of intercession is needed. It is here
the coming revival must find its strength. Let
us begin as individuals in secret to plead with God,
confessing whatever we see of sin or hindrance, in
ourselves or others. If there were not one other
sin, surely in the lack of prayer there is matter
enough for repentance and confession and returning
to the Lord. Let us seek to foster the spirit
of confession and supplication and intercession
in those around us. Let us help to encourage
and to train those who think themselves too feeble.
Let us lift up our voice to proclaim the great
<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">191</span><span class="ns">] </span>
truths. The revival must come from above; the
revival must be received in faith from above and
brought down by prayer; the revival comes to the
humble and contrite, for them to carry to others;
if we return to the Lord with our whole heart,
He will revive us. On those who see these
truths, rests the solemn responsibility of giving
themselves up to witness for them and to act them
out.</p>

<p>And as each of us pleads for the revival throughout
the Church, let us specially, at the same time,
cry to God for our own neighbourhood or sphere of
work. Let, with every minister and worker, there
be &ldquo;great searchings of heart,&rdquo; as to whether they
are ready to give such proportion of time and
strength to prayer as God would have. Let them,
even as in public they are leaders of their larger
or smaller circles, give themselves in secret to take
their places in the front rank of the great intercession
host, that must prevail with God, ere the
great revival, the floods of blessing can come. Of
all who speak or think of, or long for, revival, let
not one hold back in this great work of honest,
earnest, definite pleading: Revive Thy work, O
Lord! Wilt Thou not revive us again?</p>

<p><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">192</span><span class="ns">] </span>
Come and let us return to the Lord: He will
revive us! And let us know, let us follow on to
know the Lord. &ldquo;<em>His going forth</em> is sure as the
morning; and <em>He shall come unto us</em> as the rain,
as the latter rain that watereth the earth.&rdquo; Amen.
So be it.</p>

<h4><a name="nt.A" id="nt.A" href="#nta.A">NOTE A, Chap. VI. p. 73</a></h4>

<p>Just this day I have been meeting a very earnest lady missionary
from India. She confesses and mourns the lack of
prayer. But&mdash;in India at least&mdash;it can hardly be otherwise. You
have only the morning hours, from six to eleven, for your work.
Some have attempted to rise at four, and get the time they think
they need, and have suffered, and had to give it up. Some have
tried to take time after lunch, and been found asleep on their
knees. You are not your own master, and must act with others.
No one who has not been in India can understand the difficulty;
sufficient time for much intercession cannot be secured.</p>

<p>Were it only in the heat of India the difficulty existed, one
might be silent. But, alas! in the coldest winter in London, and
in the moderate climate of South Africa, there is the same trouble
everywhere. If once we really felt&mdash;<em>intercession is the most important
part of our work</em>, the securing of God&#8217;s presence and power in
full measure is the essential thing, this is our first duty&mdash;our
hours of work would all be made subordinate to this one thing.</p>

<p>May God show us all whether there indeed be an insuperable
difficulty for which we are not responsible, whether it be only a
mistake we are making, or a sin by which we are grieving Him and
hindering His Spirit!</p>

<p>If we ask the question George Muller once asked of a Christian,
who complained that he could not find time sufficient for the study
of the Word and prayer, whether an hour less work, say four hours,

prosperous and effective than five hours with the depressing consciousness
of unfaithfulness, and the loss of the power that could
be obtained in prayer, the answer will not be difficult. The
more we think of it the more we feel that when earnest, godly
workers allow, against their better will, the spiritual to be crowded
out by incessant occupation and the fatigue it brings, it must be
because the spiritual life is not sufficiently strong in them to bid
the lever stand aside till the presence of God in Christ and the
power of the Spirit have been fully secured.</p>

<p>Let us listen to Christ saying, &ldquo;<em>Render unto Cæsar the things
that are Cæsar&#8217;s</em>&rdquo;&mdash;let duty and work have their place&mdash;&ldquo;and unto
God the things that are God&#8217;s.&rdquo; Let the worship in the Spirit,
the entire dependence and continued waiting upon God for the full
experience of His presence and power every day, and the strength
of Christ working in us, ever have the first place. The whole
question is simply this, Is God to have the place, the love, the
trust, the time for personal fellowship He claims, so that all our
working shall be God working in us?</p>

<h4><a name="nt.B" id="nt.B" href="#nta.B">NOTE B, Chap. VII. p. 89</a></h4>

<p>Let me tell here a story that occurs in one of Dr. Boardman&#8217;s
works. He had been invited by a lady of good position, well
known as a successful worker among her husband&#8217;s dependents, to
come and address them. &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I want to
speak to you about a bit of bondage of my own.&rdquo; When he had
addressed her meeting, and found many brought to Christ through
her, he wondered what her trouble might be. She soon told him.
God had blessed her work, but, alas, the enjoyment she once had
had in God&#8217;s word and secret prayer had been lost. And she had
tried her utmost to get it back, and had failed. &ldquo;Ah! that is just
your mistake,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How that? Ought I not to do my
best to have the coldness removed?&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;were
you saved by doing your best?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, no! I tried long to do
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">195</span><span class="ns">] </span>
that, but only found rest when I ceased trying, and trusted
Christ.&rdquo; &ldquo;And that is what you need to do now. Enter your
closet at the appointed time, however dull you feel, and place
yourself before your Lord. Do not try to rouse an earnestness
you do not feel; but quietly say to Him that He sees how all
is wrong, how helpless you are, and trust Him to bless you. He
will do it; as you trust quietly, His Spirit will work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The simple story may teach many a Christian a most blessed
lesson in the life of prayer. You have accepted of Christ Jesus to
make you whole, and give you strength to walk in newness of
life; you have claimed the Holy Spirit to be in you the Spirit of
Supplication and Intercession; but do not wonder if your feelings
are not all at once changed, or if your power of prayer does
not come in the way you would like. It is a life of faith. By
faith we receive the Holy Spirit and all His workings. Faith
regards neither sight nor feeling, but rests, even when there
appears to be no power to pray, in the assurance that the Spirit is
praying in us as we bow quietly before God. He that thus waits
in faith, and honours the Holy Spirit, and yields himself to Him,
will soon find that prayer will begin to come. And he that
perseveres in the faith that through Christ and by the Spirit
each prayer, however feeble, is acceptable to God, will learn the
lesson that it is possible to be taught by the Spirit, and led to
walk worthy of the Lord to all well pleasing.</p>

<p>Just yesterday again&mdash;three days after the conversation mentioned
in the note to chap. vii.&mdash;I met a devoted young missionary
lady from the interior. As a conversation on prayer was
proceeding, she interposed unasked with the remark, &ldquo;But it is
really impossible to find the time to pray as we wish to.&rdquo; I could
only answer, &ldquo;Time is a quantity that accommodates itself to our
will; what our hearts really consider of <em>first importance</em> in the day,
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">196</span><span class="ns">] </span>
we will soon succeed in finding time for.&rdquo; It must surely be that
the ministry of intercession has never been put before our students
in Theological Halls and Missionary Training Homes as the most
important part of their life-work. We have thought of our work
in preaching or visiting as our real duty, and of prayer as a
subordinate means to do this work successfully. Would not
the whole position be changed if we regarded the ministry of
intercession as the chief thing&mdash;<em>getting the blessing and power of
God</em> for the souls entrusted to us? Then our work would take its
right place, and become the subordinate one of really dispensing
blessings which we had received from God. It was when the
friend at midnight, in answer to his prayer, had received from
Another as much as he needed, that he could supply his hungry
friend. It was the intercession, going out and importuning, that
was the difficult work; returning home with his rich supply to
impart was easy, joyful work. This is Christ&#8217;s divine order for
all thy work, my brother: First come, in utter poverty, every day,
and get from God the blessing in intercession, go then rejoicingly
to impart it.</p>

<p>Let me once again refer my readers to William Law, and repeat
what I have said before, that no book has so helped me to
an insight into the place and work of the Holy Spirit in the
economy of redemption as his <span class="smc">Address to the Clergy</span>.<sup><a name="fna.2" id="fna.2"
 href="#fn.2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The way in which he opens up how God&#8217;s one object was to dwell
in man, making him partaker of His goodness and glory, other
way than by himself living and working in him, gives one
the key to what Pentecost and the sending forth of the Spirit of
God&#8217;s Son into our hearts really means. It is Christ in God&#8217;s
<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">197</span><span class="ns">] </span>
name really regaining and retaking possession of the home He had
created for Himself. It is God entering into the secret depths of our
nature there to &ldquo;work to will and to do,&rdquo; to &ldquo;work that which is
pleasing in His sight in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; It is as this truth enters
into us, and we see that there is and can be no good in us but
what God works, that we shall see light on the Divine mystery
of prayer, and believe in the Holy Spirit as breathing within us
desires which God will fulfil when we yield to them, and believingly
present them in the name of Christ. We shall then see that
just as wonderful and prevailing as the intercession and prayer
passing from the Incarnate Son to the Father in heaven is our
intercourse with God; the Spirit, who is God, breathing and praying
in us amid all our feebleness His heaven-born Divine petitions:
what a heavenly thing prayer becomes.</p>

<p>The latter part of the above-mentioned book consists of extracts
from Law&#8217;s letters. These have been published separately as a
little shilling volume.<sup><a name="fna.3" id="fna.3"
 href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> No one who will take the time quietly
to read and master the so simple but deep teaching they contain,
without being wonderfully strengthened in the confidence which is
needed, if we are to pray much and boldly. As we learn that the
Holy Spirit is within us to reveal Christ there, to make us in
living reality partakers of His death, His life, His merit, His
disposition, so that He is formed within us, we will begin to see
how Divinely right and sure it is that our intercessions in His
name must be heard; his own Spirit maintains the living union
with Himself, in whom we are brought nigh to God, and gives us
boldness of access; what I have so feebly said in the chapter on
the Spirit of Supplication will get new meaning; and, what is
more, the exercise of prayer a new attractiveness; its solemn
Divine mystery will humble us, its unspeakable privilege lift us
up in faith and adoration.</p>

<a name="nt.E" id="nt.E" href="#nta.E">NOTE E, Chap. XI. p. 136</a></h4>

<p>There is a question, the deepest of all, on which I have not
entered in this book. I have spoken of the lack of prayer in the
individual Christian as a symptom of a disease. But what shall
we say of it, that there is such a widespread prevalence of this
failure to give a due proportion of time and strength to prayer?
Do we not need to inquire, How comes it that the Church of
Christ, endued with the Holy Ghost, cannot train its ministers and
workers and members to place first what is first? How comes it
that the confession of too little prayer, and the call for more
prayer, is so frequently heard, and yet the evil continues? The
Spirit of God, the Spirit of Supplication and Intercession, is in the
Church and in every believer. There must surely be some other
spirit of great power resisting and hindering this Spirit of God.
It is indeed so. The spirit of the world, which under all its
beautiful and even religious activities is the spirit of the god of
this world, is the great hindrance. Everything that is done on
earth, whether within or without the Church, is done by either of
these two spirits. What is in the individual the flesh, is in mankind
as a whole the spirit of the world; and all the power the
flesh has in the individual is owing to the place given to the spirit
of this world in the Church and in Christian life. It is the spirit
of the world is the great hindrance to the spirit of prayer. All
our most earnest calls to men to pray more will be vain except this
evil be acknowledged and combated and overcome. The believer
and the Church must be entirely freed from the spirit of the world.</p>

<p>And how is this to be done? There is but one way&mdash;the Cross of
Christ, &ldquo;by which,&rdquo; as Paul says, &ldquo;the world is crucified unto
me, and I unto the world.&rdquo; It is only through death to the world
that we can be freed from its spirit. The separation must be vital
and entire. It is only through the acceptance of our crucifixion
with Christ that we can live out this confession, and, as crucified
to the world, maintain the position of irreconcilable hostility to
whatever is of its spirit and not of the Spirit of God; and it is
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">199</span><span class="ns">] </span>
only God Himself who, by His Divine power, can lead us into and
keep us daily dead to sin, and alive unto God in Christ Jesus.
The cross, with its shame and its separation from the world, and
its death to all that is of flesh and of self, is the only power that
can conquer the spirit of the world.</p>

<p>I have felt so strongly that the truth needs to be anew asserted,
that I hope, if it please God, to publish a volume, <em>The Cross of
Christ</em>, with the inquiry into what God&#8217;s word teaches as to our
actual participation with Christ in His crucifixion. Christ prayed
on the way to the cross. He prayed Himself to the cross. He
prayed on the cross. He prays ever as the fruit of the cross. As
the Church lives on the cross, and the cross lives in the Church,
the spirit of prayer will be given. In Christ it was the crucifixion
spirit and death that was the source of the Intercession
Spirit and Power. With us it can be no otherwise.</p>

<hr class="note" />
<h4><a name="nt.F" id="nt.F" href="#nta.F">NOTE F, Chap. XIV. p. 177</a></h4>

<p>I have more than once spoken of the need of training Christians
to the work of intercession. In a previous note I have asked the
question whether, in the teaching of our Theological Halls and
Mission Training Houses, sufficient attention is given to prayer as
the most important, and in some senses the most difficult part of the
work for which the students are being prepared. I have wondered
whether it might not be possible to offer those who are willing,
during their student life, to put themselves under a course of
training, some help in the way of hints and suggestions as to what
is needed to give prayer the place and the power in our ministry
it ought to have.</p>

<p>As a rule, it is in the student life that the character must be
formed for future years, and it is in the present student world that
the Church of the future must be influenced. If God allows me to
carry out a plan that is hardly quite mature yet, I would wish to

publish a volume, <span class="smc">The Student&#8217;s Prayer Manual</span>, combining
the teaching of Scripture as to what is most needed to make
men of prayer of us, with such practical directions as may help a
young Christian, preparing to devote his life to God&#8217;s service successfully,
to cultivate such a spirit and habit of prayer as shall
abide with him through all his coming life and labours.</p>

<p><b>Pray without Ceasing.</b>&mdash;Who can do this? How can one do it
who is surrounded by the cares of daily life?&mdash;How can a mother
love her child without ceasing? How can the eyelid without
ceasing hold itself ready to protect the eye? How can I breathe
and feel and hear without ceasing? Because all these are the
functions of a healthy, natural life. And so, if the spiritual life
be healthy, under the full power of the Holy Spirit, praying
without ceasing will be natural.</p>

<p><b>Pray without Ceasing.</b>&mdash;Does it refer to continual acts of
prayer, in which we are to persevere till we obtain, or to the spirit
of prayerfulness that should animate us all the day? It includes
both. The example of our Lord Jesus shows us this. We have
to enter our closet for special seasons of prayer; we are at times
to persevere there in importunate prayer. We are also all the
day to walk in God&#8217;s presence, with the whole heart set upon
heavenly things. Without set times of prayer the spirit of prayer
will be dull and feeble. Without the continual prayerfulness the
set times will not avail.</p>

<p><b>Pray without Ceasing.</b>&mdash;Does that refer to prayer for ourselves
or others? To both. It is because many confine it to themselves
that they fail so in practising it. It is only when the branch
gives itself to bear fruit, more fruit, much fruit, that it can live a
healthy life, and expect a rich inflow of sap. The death of Christ
brought Him to the place of everlasting intercession. Your death
with Him to sin and self sets you free from the care of self, and
elevates you to the dignity of intercessor&mdash;one who can get life and
blessing from God for others. Know your calling; begin this your
work. Give yourself wholly to it, and ere you know you will be
finding something of this &ldquo;<em>Praying always</em>&rdquo; within you.</p>

<p><b>Pray without Ceasing.</b>&mdash;How can I learn it? The best way of
learning to do a thing&mdash;in fact the only way&mdash;is <em>to do it</em>. Begin
by setting apart some time every day, say ten or fifteen minutes,
<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">203</span><span class="ns">] </span>
in which you say to God and to yourself, that you come to Him
now as intercessor for others. Let it be after your morning or
evening prayer, or any other time. If you cannot secure the same
time every day, be not troubled. Only see that you do your
work. Christ chose you and appointed you to pray for others.</p>

<p>If at first you do not feel any special urgency or faith or power
in your prayers, let not that hinder you. Quietly tell your Lord
Jesus of your feebleness; believe that the Holy Spirit is in you to
teach you to pray, and be assured that if you begin, God will help
you. God cannot help you unless you begin and keep on.</p>

<p><b>Pray without Ceasing.</b>&mdash;How do I know what to pray for?
If once you begin, and think of all the needs around you, you will
soon find enough. But to help you this little tract is issued, with
subjects and hints for prayer for a month. It is meant that we
should use it month by month, until we know more fully to
follow the Spirit&#8217;s leading, and have learnt, if need be, to make our
own list of subjects, and can dispense with it. In regard to the
use of these helps a few words may be needed.</p>

<p><b>1. How to Pray.</b>&mdash;You notice for every day two headings&mdash;the
one <b>What to Pray</b>; the other, <b>How to Pray</b>. If the subjects were
only given, one might fall into the routine of mentioning names
and things before God, and the work become a burden. The hints
under the heading <b>How to Pray</b> are meant to remind of the
spiritual nature of the work, of the need of Divine help, and to
encourage faith in the certainty that God, through the Spirit,
will give us grace to pray aright, and will also hear our prayer.
One does not at once learn to take his place boldly, and to dare to
believe that he will be heard. Therefore take a few moments each
day to listen to God&#8217;s voice reminding you of how certainly even
you will be heard, and calling on you to pray in that faith in your
Father, to claim and take the blessing you plead for. And let
these words about <b>How to Pray</b> enter your hearts and occupy your
thoughts at other times too. The work of intercession is Christ&#8217;s
great work on earth, intrusted to Him because He gave Himself a
sacrifice to God for men. The work of intercession is the
greatest work a Christian can do. Give yourself a sacrifice to
God for men, and the work will become your glory and your joy
too.</p>

<p><b>2. What to Pray.</b>&mdash;Scripture calls us to pray for many things:
for all saints; for all men; for kings and all rulers; for all who
are in adversity; for the sending forth of labourers; for those
who labour in the gospel; for all converts; for believers who have
fallen into sin; for one another in our own immediate circles.
The Church is now so much larger than when the New Testament
was written; the number of forms of work and workers is so
much greater; the needs of the Church and the world are so
much better known, that we need to take time and thought to see
where prayer is needed, and to what our heart is most drawn out.
<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">204</span><span class="ns">] </span>
The Scripture calls to prayer demand a large heart, taking in all
saints, and all men, and all needs. An attempt has been made in
these helps to indicate what the chief subjects are that need
prayer, and that ought to interest every Christian.</p>

<p>It will be felt difficult by many to pray for such large spheres as
are sometimes mentioned. Let it be understood that in each case
we may make special intercession for our own circle of interest coming
under that heading. And it is hardly needful to say, further, that
where one subject appears of more special interest or urgency than
another we are free for a time day after day to take up that subject.
If only time be really given to intercession, and the spirit of
believing intercession be cultivated, the object is attained. While,
on the one hand, the heart must be enlarged at times to take in
all, the more pointed and definite our prayer can be the better.
With this view paper is left blank in which we can write down
special petitions we desire to urge before God.</p>

<p><a name="answers" id="answers"></a><b>3. Answers to Prayer.</b>&mdash;More than one little book has been
published in which Christians may keep a register of their petitions,
and note when they were answered. Room has been left on every
page for this, so that more definite petitions with regard to individual
souls or special spheres of work may be recorded, and the
answer looked for. When we pray for all saints, or for missions in
general, it is difficult to know when or how our prayer is answered,
or whether our prayer has had any part in bringing the answer.
It is of extreme importance that we should prove that God
hears us, and to this end take note of what answers we look for,
and when they come. On the day of praying for all saints, take the
saints in your congregation, or in your prayer-meeting, and ask for
a revival among them. Take, in connection with missions, some
special station or missionary you are interested in, or more than
one, and plead for blessing. And expect and look for its coming,
that you may praise God.</p>

<p><b>4. Prayer Circles.</b>&mdash;There is no desire in publishing this invitation
to intercession to add another to the many existing prayer
unions or praying bands. The first object is to stir the many
Christians who practically, through ignorance of their calling, or
unbelief as to their prayer availing much, take but very little part in
the work of intercession; and then to help those who do pray to
some fuller apprehension of the greatness of the work, and the need
of giving their whole strength to it. There is a circle of prayer
which asks for prayer on the first day of every month for the fuller
manifestation of the power of the Holy Spirit throughout the
Church. I have given the words of that invitation as subject for
the first day, and taken the same thought as keynote all through.
The more one thinks of the need and the promise, and the greatness
of the obstacles to be overcome in prayer, the more one feels
it must become our life-work day by day, that to which every
other interest is subordinated.</p>

<p><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span class="pgmark">205</span><span class="ns">] </span>
But while not forming a large prayer union, it is suggested that
it may be found helpful to have small prayer circles to unite in
prayer, either for one month, with some special object introduced
daily along with the others, or through a year or longer, with the
view of strengthening each other in the grace of intercession. If a
minister were to invite some of his neighbouring brethren to join
for some special requests along with the printed subjects for supplication,
or a number of the more earnest members of his congregation
to unite in prayer for revival, some might be trained to take their
place in the great work of intercession, who now stand idle because
no man hath hired them.</p>

<p><b>5. Who is sufficient for these things?</b>&mdash;The more we study and
try to practise this grace of intercession, the more we become overwhelmed
by its greatness and our feebleness. Let every such
impression lead us to listen: <b>My grace is sufficient for thee</b>,
and to answer truthfully: <b>Our sufficiency is of God</b>. Take
courage; it is in the intercession of Christ you are called to take
part. The burden and the agony, the triumph and the victory
are all His. Learn from Him, yield to His Spirit in you, to know
how to pray. He gave Himself a sacrifice to God for men, that He
might have the right and power of intercession. &ldquo;He bare the sin
of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.&rdquo; Let your
faith rest boldly on His finished work. Let your heart wholly
identify itself with Him in His death and His life. <b>Like Him</b>,
give yourself <b>to God</b> a sacrifice for men: it is your highest
nobility, it is your true and full union to Him; it will be to you, as
to Him, your power of intercession. Beloved Christian! come and
give your whole heart and life to intercession, and you will know
its blessedness and its power. God asks nothing less; the world
needs nothing less; Christ asks nothing less; let nothing less be
what we offer to God.</p>

<p>God is the Holy One. His people is a holy people. He speaks:
I am holy: I am the Lord which make you holy. Christ
prayed: Sanctify them. Make them holy through <b>Thy Truth</b>.
Paul prayed: &ldquo;God establish your hearts unblamable in holiness.&rdquo;
&ldquo;God sanctify you wholly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pray for all saints&mdash;God&#8217;s holy ones&mdash;throughout the Church,
that the Spirit of holiness may rule them. Specially for new
converts. For the saints in your own neighbourhood or congregation.
For any you are specially interested in. Think of their
special need, weakness, or sin, and pray that God may make them
holy.</p>

<p>The things that are impossible with men are possible with
God. When we think of the great things we ask for, of how little
likelihood there is of their coming, of our own insignificance. Prayer
is not only wishing, or asking, but believing and accepting. Be
still before God and ask Him to give you to know Him as the
Almighty One, and leave your petitions with Him who doeth
wonders.</p>

come, will convict the world in respect of sin.&rdquo;</b>&mdash;<span class="smc">John</span> xvi. 7,&nbsp;8.</p></div>

<p>God&#8217;s one desire, the one object of Christ&#8217;s being manifested, is
to take away sin. The first work of the Spirit on the world is
conviction of sin. Without that, no deep or abiding revival, no
powerful conversion. Pray for it, that the gospel may be
preached in such power of the Spirit, that men may see that
they have rejected and crucified Christ, and cry out, What shall
we do?</p>

<p>Pray most earnestly for a mighty power of conviction of sin
wherever the gospel is preached.</p>

<p>First, take hold of God&#8217;s strength. God is a Spirit. I cannot
take hold of Him, and hold Him fast, but by the Spirit. Take
hold of God&#8217;s strength, and hold on till it has done for you what
He has promised. Pray for the power of the Spirit to convict
of sin.</p>

<p>Second, stir up yourself, the power that is in you by the Holy
Spirit, to take hold. Give your whole heart and will to it, and
say, <b>I will not let Thee go except Thou bless me</b>.</p>

<p>A washing by fire! a cleansing by judgment! He that has
passed through this shall be called holy. The power of blessing
for the world, the power of work and intercession that will avail,
depends upon the spiritual state of the Church; and that can
only rise higher as sin is discovered and put away. Judgment
must begin at the house of God. There must be conviction of sin
for sanctification. Beseech God to give His Spirit as a spirit of
judgment and a spirit of burning&mdash;to discover and burn out sin
in His people.</p>

<p>Ask in the name of your Redeemer God, who sits upon the

that sin may be put away from among His people. Ask&mdash;the
prayer is after His own heart&mdash;for the spirit of deep conviction of
sin to come among His people. Ask for the spirit of burning.
Ask in the faith of His name&mdash;the faith of what He wills, of what
He can do&mdash;and look for the answer. Pray that the Church may
be blessed, to be made a blessing in the world.</p>

<p>God lives, and listens to every petition with His whole heart.
Each time we pray the whole Infinite God is there to hear. He
asks that in each prayer the whole man shall be there too; that
we shall cry with our whole heart. Christ gave Himself to God
for men; and so He takes up every need into His intercession. If
once we seek God with our whole heart, the whole heart will be in
every prayer with which we come to this God. Pray with your
whole heart for the young.</p>

<p>Beware, in your prayer, above everything, of limiting God, not
only by unbelief, but by fancying that you know what He can do.
Expect unexpected things, above all that we ask or think. Each

Think of what He can do, of how He delights to hear Christ, of
your place in Christ, and expect great things.</p>

world; for rulers in cities or districts in which we are interested.
When God&#8217;s people unite in this, they may count upon their
prayer effecting in the unseen world more than they know. Let
faith hold this fast.</p>

them that are evil entreated, as being yourselves in the body.&rdquo;</b>&mdash;<span class="smc">Heb.</span>
xiii.&nbsp;3.</p></div>

<p>What a world of suffering we live in! How Jesus sacrificed all
and identified Himself with it! Let us in our measure do so too.
The persecuted Stundists and Armenians and Jews, the famine-stricken
millions of India, the hidden slavery of Africa, the poverty
and wretchedness of our great cities&mdash;and so much more: what
suffering among those who know God and who know Him not.
And then in smaller circles, in ten thousand homes and hearts,
what sorrow. In our own neighbourhood, how many needing
help or comfort. Let us have a heart for, let us think of the
suffering. It will stir us to pray, to work, to hope, to love more.
And in a way and time we know not God will hear our prayer.</p>

<p>Do you not begin to feel prayer is really the help for this
sinful world? What a need there is of unceasing prayer? The very
greatness of the task makes us despair! What can our ten
minutes of intercession avail? It is right we feel this: this is the
way in which God is calling and preparing us to give our life to
prayer. Give yourself wholly to God for men, and amid all your
work, your heart will be drawn out to men in love, and drawn up
to God in dependence and expectation. To a heart thus led by
the Holy Spirit, it is possible to pray always and not to faint.</p>

<p>You have your own special work; make it a work of intercession.
Paul laboured, striving according to the working of God
in him. Remember, God is not only the Creator, but the Great
Workman, who worketh all in all. You can only do your work in
His strength, by Him working in you through the Spirit. Intercede
much for those among whom you work, till God gives you
life for them.</p>

<p>Let us all intercede too for each other, for every worker throughout
God&#8217;s Church, however solitary or unknown.</p>

iv.&nbsp;8.</p></div>

<p>The nearness of God gives rest and power in prayer. The nearness
of God is given to him who makes it his first object. &ldquo;Draw
nigh to God&rdquo;; seek the nearness to Him, and He will give it;
&ldquo;He will draw nigh to you.&rdquo; Then it becomes easy to pray in
faith.</p>

<p>Remember that when first God takes you into the school of
intercession it is almost more for your own sake than that of
others. You have to be trained to love, and wait, and pray, and
believe. Only persevere. Learn to set yourself in His presence,
to wait quietly for the assurance that He draws nigh. Enter
His holy presence, tarry there, and spread your work before Him.
Intercede for the souls you are working among. Get a blessing
from God, His Spirit into your own heart, for them.</p>

to their needs. Pray for conversions. Pray for the power of the
Spirit to manifest itself. Band yourself with others to join in

<p>Christ&#8217;s power to save, and save completely, depends on His
unceasing intercession. The apostles withdrawing themselves
from other work to give themselves continually to prayer was
followed by the number of the disciples multiplying exceedingly.
As we, in our day, give ourselves to intercession, we shall have
more and mightier conversions. Let us plead for this. Christ
is exalted to give repentance. The Church exists with the Divine
purpose and promise of having conversions. Let us not be
ashamed to confess our sin and feebleness, and cry to God for
more conversions in Christian and heathen lands, of those too
whom you know and love. Plead for the salvation of sinners.</p>

<p>You feel unworthy and unable to pray aright. To accept this
heartily, and to be content still to come and be blest in your
unworthiness, is true humility. It proves its integrity by not
seeking for anything, but simply trusting His grace. And so it is
the very strength of a great faith, and gets a full answer. &ldquo;Yet
the dogs&rdquo;&mdash;let that be your plea as you persevere for someone
possibly possessed of the devil. Let not your littleness hinder
you for a moment.</p>

<p>How many new converts who remain feeble; how many who

pray specially for the young converts. How many stand alone,
surrounded by temptation; how many have no teaching on the
Spirit in them, and the power of God to establish them; how
many in heathen lands, surrounded by Satan&#8217;s power. If you
pray for the power of the Spirit in the Church, pray specially that
every young convert may know that he may claim and receive the

<p>It is sin against the Lord to cease praying for others. When
once we begin to see how absolutely indispensable intercession is,
just as much a duty as loving God or believing in Christ, and how
we are called and bound to it as believers, we shall feel that to
cease intercession is grievous sin. Let us ask for grace to take up
our place as priests with joy, and give our life to bring down
the blessing of heaven.</p>
